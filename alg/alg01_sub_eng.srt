Hello and welcome to the video course called Algebra.

2
00:00:05,015 --> 00:00:12,252
This is a new video series here on the channel. Which nicely puts my other courses closer together.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,452
Of course you might know that algebra is a huge part of mathematics and it can mean a lot of different things.

4
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:25,866
Therefore let me tell you that here we have an introduction to algebra in a video course.

5
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:31,504
So you don't need a lot of prerequisites here to understand the first videos.

6
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:39,033
However since this is a very abstract topic, I would say this is not one of the easiest courses I have.

7
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:46,293
Still you might know the topics we learn here are important and useful for other parts of mathematics.

8
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:54,213
Ok and here you see the only prerequisite we have is that you know the stuff in my "start learning mathematics" series.

9
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:59,516
In particular you should be familiar with the construction of the number sets,

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,014
because that's something we will immediately generalize in our algebra setting.

11
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:13,417
Ok, here you also see my other basic video courses are not required and are more or less on the same level.

12
00:01:13,617 --> 00:01:22,140
However they are less abstract and therefore I would say it's still helpful to have some knowledge of calculus and linear algebra.

13
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,072
Indeed, this helps to understand why we even ask some questions in algebra,

14
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,771
but of course your personal taste could be completely different than mine.

15
00:01:32,886 --> 00:01:39,068
Maybe you don't like this concrete level in calculus, but really like this abstract level in algebra.

16
00:01:39,586 --> 00:01:44,541
In this case you did the correct choice watching this video series here

17
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:50,322
and this is a good point in the video to thank all the nice people, that made this video course possible.

18
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:59,354
As a supporter on Steady, on Patreon or here on YouTube, you make it possible that I can create a lot of math videos

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,890
and you might already know, as a reward you get PDF versions, quizzes and exercises for all the videos.

20
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:13,996
Ok, then the next question might be: "What can you expect of this video course about algebra, here?"

21
00:02:14,196 --> 00:02:19,108
and indeed this is easy to answer, because I have a nice summary.

22
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:24,710
We will first talk about groups, then about rings and in the end about fields.

23
00:02:25,586 --> 00:02:28,943
In fact you might already know all these concepts here,

24
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:35,614
because they were needed and defined when we constructed the number sets in the "start learning mathematics" series.

25
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:42,657
A very important example of a group would be the integers together with the addition.

26
00:02:43,257 --> 00:02:50,579
So we need a set together with an operation and most crucially all the inverses have to lie in the set.

27
00:02:50,914 --> 00:02:57,155
In other words we can generalize this concept of the integers and talk about an abstract group

28
00:02:57,355 --> 00:03:05,491
and then it turns out that this new concept is more powerful and can do way more than just describing numbers.

29
00:03:05,691 --> 00:03:11,953
Now, on the other hand the integers are also a good example for a so called ring.

30
00:03:12,153 --> 00:03:19,434
There the integers need more structures. Namely besides the addition we also need the multiplication.

31
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:23,709
Hence a ring is just a set together with two operations.

32
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:28,722
Therefore for the one operation, we don't need all the inverses in the set.

33
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:33,958
In fact by having more inverses, we reach the concept of a field

34
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:41,077
and there the typical example would be the real numbers with all the calculation rules you know.

35
00:03:41,277 --> 00:03:48,759
Therefore a field generalizes all these rich calculation rules we have for the real numbers in an abstract setting.

36
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:58,665
Ok and at this point I should tell you that in this video course we will learn that all these abstract concepts have nice applications

37
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:02,594
and they go beyond just calculating with numbers.

38
00:04:02,914 --> 00:04:10,557
For example if you want to solve a Rubik's cube, it turns out that all the moves together form a group.

39
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:15,869
The crucial part here is that every move you can do can be reversed

40
00:04:16,486 --> 00:04:22,182
and this guarantees that the Rubik's cube can be solved, if you started with a solved one.

41
00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:29,515
However one interesting fact here I can tell you is that this group is not a commutative one.

42
00:04:30,157 --> 00:04:36,529
This means in contrast to adding integers, here the order of operations matters.

43
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:41,871
Now, on the other hand we also get applications on a more abstract level.

44
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:47,683
In particular this whole algebra concept tells us about solutions of equations. 

45
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:55,176
For example you might want to have the real or complex solutions of this equation.

46
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,617
You see it's a polynomial equation with degree 5

47
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:06,925
and now with algebra we can show that we have at most 5 different solutions of this equation.

48
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:17,002
However our abstract algebra concepts here also show that we can not have a general solution formula for these solutions.

49
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:26,236
More precisely it means that the solutions can not be expressed by using the integers, roots and the basic calculation symbols.

50
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:33,024
This is something that is indeed possible, if the degree here is less or equal than 4.

51
00:05:33,486 --> 00:05:40,539
However at degree 5 this breaks down, which algebra or more precisely Galois theory shows.

52
00:05:41,314 --> 00:05:47,971
Now, in order to check this interesting fact let's put this particular equation into Wolfram Alpha

53
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:55,405
and there we see Wolfram Alpha is not able to give more than just an approximation of the solutions

54
00:05:55,871 --> 00:06:04,508
and indeed we also see more. The graph of this polynomial is given here and we have only 3 real solutions.

55
00:06:05,143 --> 00:06:10,493
The other 2 of the possible 5 are now found in the complex domain.

56
00:06:10,857 --> 00:06:18,959
However, the result here is that for none of these complex solutions we have a formula that is expressed with roots.

57
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:27,452
Now, at this point you might criticize me and tell me that in Wolfram Alpha you find this button "exact forms",

58
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:36,053
but after pressing it, we still don't have a formula with just roots, because there are very complicated functions involved

59
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:42,159
and at this point it might be helpful to compare this to an equation with degree 4.

60
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:46,516
So let's change the power to 4 and let's see what we get.

61
00:06:47,414 --> 00:06:53,885
Again we just get approximations, but now let's see what the exact forms are

62
00:06:54,371 --> 00:07:05,191
and there you see, now we can use integers, roots of higher degree and just the basic calculation operations to formulate this solution

63
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:11,250
and indeed, this formula with roots works for each of the 4 solutions

64
00:07:12,043 --> 00:07:18,016
and the reason why we have this nice fact, the Galois theory will tell us later,

65
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:22,764
but before we do that we will first start discussing groups.

66
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:29,743
So let's do that in the next video and I really hope that I see you there. Have a nice day and Bye.
