00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,808
Hello and welcome back to the video series about ODEs.

2
00:00:06,386 --> 00:00:14,542
So you see we are still in the beginning of the topic and in today's part 2 we will first define the important notions we need.

3
00:00:14,742 --> 00:00:20,307
So for example we will give the definition what we mean by an ODE.

4
00:00:20,507 --> 00:00:27,583
However, before we do that I first want to thank all the nice people who support this channel on Steady, via Paypal or by other means

5
00:00:28,243 --> 00:00:34,778
and please don't forget, in the description you find the link, where you can download the PDF version and a quiz for this video.

6
00:00:34,978 --> 00:00:41,121
Ok, then without further ado let's start with the important definitions we will need in this series.

7
00:00:41,586 --> 00:00:46,674
First of all we will often deal with a set of functions called C^k

8
00:00:46,874 --> 00:00:52,418
and usually the domain of definition for these functions is given by an interval "I".

9
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:57,890
Hence when you see capital "I" it's always a subset of the real number line.

10
00:00:58,529 --> 00:01:06,376
Now in fact most of the time in this series it will denote an interval, but sometimes it will denote a general open set

11
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:12,196
and in some other cases we might want that "I" stands for a union of 2 intervals.

12
00:01:12,396 --> 00:01:17,736
So you see, depending on what we want to do later, we will stretch this definition a little bit,

13
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:20,557
but here we will start with an interval "I"

14
00:01:20,884 --> 00:01:25,901
and then this set C^k is well-defined as a set of functions

15
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:34,398
and here we immediately see the first special feature of this topic, because we will denote functions by a lower case x.

16
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,556
Hence x is a function, where the domain of definition is "I"

17
00:01:39,986 --> 00:01:43,168
and it simply maps into the real number line

18
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:52,380
and now you should recall from real analysis that C^k means that the function x is k-times continuously differentiable.

19
00:01:52,914 --> 00:01:58,895
This means the kth order derivative of x exists and is a continuous function.

20
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:06,205
Moreover I should tell you here that the variable name we want to use for the function x is usually a lower case t.

21
00:02:06,614 --> 00:02:09,623
This means we will write x(t).

22
00:02:09,823 --> 00:02:16,809
I tell you that, because if we choose the variable name as t, we will use a dot for denoting derivatives.

23
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:21,583
Hence the first derivative here would be the function x dot.

24
00:02:21,783 --> 00:02:25,390
Then the second derivative would be x dot dot

25
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,659
and so on and of course if we need too many dots, we will use the common upper index notation.

26
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:37,904
Of course in situations where the dot could be confusing, we will just use other notations.

27
00:02:38,104 --> 00:02:42,785
So for example you know the common prime notation or the Leibniz notation.

28
00:02:42,985 --> 00:02:47,789
So please keep that in mind. Depending on the context or depending on which book you read,

29
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:51,072
you will see different notations for the derivative.

30
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:56,621
However the definition for an ODE should be the same.

31
00:02:57,171 --> 00:03:02,496
Namely it should be given by a combination of the derivatives of the function x.

32
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:06,466
Indeed, we could write it down by a functional relation.

33
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:10,116
For that we take a continuous function capital F

34
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:15,694
and then we have different inputs. First of all the independent variable t

35
00:03:15,894 --> 00:03:20,941
and then the function x and the derivatives of x up to some order.

36
00:03:21,141 --> 00:03:25,886
So as before we could say that the highest derivative is the kth order.

37
00:03:26,271 --> 00:03:30,447
Ok and now this function with all the inputs should be equal to 0.

38
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:38,368
Ok, so you see in general this is what we mean when we talk of an ODE of order k

39
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:42,938
and maybe let's immediately look at an example for such an equation.

40
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:52,864
So we could have t + x + 2xdot + second derivative of x squared

41
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:56,339
and then this should be equal to 0.

42
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,563
So there you see, this is a well defined ODE of second order.

43
00:04:02,763 --> 00:04:07,900
So the highest derivative that occurs in the equation gives us the order

44
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:15,831
and at this point you might say, it might be easier for us if we first start with first order differential equations.

45
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:22,728
In fact soon we will see why it's very helpful to start with the first order differential equations.

46
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:29,666
Ok, but now it's helpful for the next definitions to abbreviate the term ordinary differential equation.

47
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:36,312
From now on we will simply write ODE if we need to keep it short and compact.

48
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:42,129
Therefore in the next definition we will explain explicit ODEs of order 1.

49
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:49,051
Here explicit means that the derivative we are interested in is on the one side of the equation

50
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:54,417
and all the other terms like the function x and the variable t are on the other side

51
00:04:54,914 --> 00:04:59,054
and both things we can rewrite with a function w.

52
00:04:59,254 --> 00:05:02,895
Hence w gets 2 inputs, t and x.

53
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:08,202
Moreover we would say w is a function defined on 2 intervals.

54
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,075
So we have the interval "I" for t and the interval J for x

55
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:18,376
and in this case here both are simply intervals from the real number line.

56
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:25,192
Ok, so in summary you see here, this one is a special case of our general case from above.

57
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:28,569
However it's the common one we will examine.

58
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,235
That's because the 2 restrictions we have here are actually not big restrictions.

59
00:05:34,857 --> 00:05:39,304
Indeed we will discuss soon why this case here is very general,

60
00:05:39,504 --> 00:05:44,967
but first I would say let's look at an example of an explicit ODE of order 1.

61
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:49,516
Hence we already know, on the left-hand side we need to have x dot

62
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:54,374
and now on the right-hand side for example we could have x + t

63
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:58,868
So you see, the function w doesn't have to be very complicated.

64
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:04,066
In fact here the domain of definition is simply R^2.

65
00:06:04,557 --> 00:06:10,085
Ok, but at this point you might remember what we have discussed in the last video.

66
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:15,048
There we had examples where more than 1 variable were involved.

67
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,533
Therefore we might ask: "is there also an example here for an explicit ODE of order 1?"

68
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:30,570
So you could write x_1 dot, the first variable for x is equal to the second variable x_2 + t

69
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,830
and then we could have a similar equation for x_2 dot.

70
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,362
Now this one could be x_1 + t.

71
00:06:38,562 --> 00:06:45,405
Now, important to note here is, these are not just 2 individual ODEs of order 1.

72
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:49,950
Otherwise it would not be allowed to mix the variables in this way.

73
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:54,988
However we can just put them together and call it a system of ODEs

74
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:59,644
and in fact a system of ODEs looks exactly the same again.

75
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:03,205
We simply have to write it as a vector equation.

76
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:11,365
So the derivative of the vector x_1, x_2 is equal to a vector given by the right-hand side here

77
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:16,561
and of course this one can be expressed again by a function w.

78
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:23,558
So w gets again 2 inputs, but now the second input is a vector instead of the variable x

79
00:07:23,758 --> 00:07:31,301
and then you should see, if we call the vector (x_1, x_2) simply x again, it has the same form as before.

80
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:37,124
In other words now we are able to define the term system of ODEs.

81
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:45,601
More precisely you would say we have an n-dimensional system of explicit ODEs of order 1,

82
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:52,086
but you might already know in the end we will also just say ODE for such a system.

83
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:57,760
Simply because from the form, from the looks it's the same as our original definition.

84
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:02,835
However don't forget, the value x(t) is now a vector.

85
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:06,881
More precisely we would say it's a n-dimensional vector.

86
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:11,929
So in other words our system now could have n equations here.

87
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:16,544
Hence the function w now also maps into R^n.

88
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:21,797
Moreover the domain of definition also changes for the second variable.

89
00:08:22,471 --> 00:08:27,094
Usually we would say we have U there, which is an open set in R^n,

90
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:34,277
but as we said at the beginning also that changes a little bit depending which problem we consider.

91
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:41,280
Ok, but for the moment I would say we have a very nice definition for what we mean when we say ODE.

92
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:47,661
So this is a very general construct, but you see one important ingredient is still missing here.

93
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:56,693
So now we know what an ODE is, but we remember for applications we are always interested in solutions of this ODE.

94
00:08:56,893 --> 00:09:02,893
So know the question is: what is a solution of a system of ODEs?

95
00:09:03,414 --> 00:09:09,268
Of course it should be a function that is differentiable and can be put into the equation

96
00:09:09,468 --> 00:09:13,656
and then it should fulfill the equation for all points t.

97
00:09:13,856 --> 00:09:20,073
However there you already see, the domain of definition doesn't have to be the whole interval "I".

98
00:09:20,386 --> 00:09:25,901
Indeed, it could be any subinterval which we can call t_0 to t_1.

99
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:31,930
So this is an open interval and now the solution function we can simply call alpha.

100
00:09:32,543 --> 00:09:37,268
So alpha is defined on this interval and it maps into R^n.

101
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:41,360
More precisely it has to map into the subset U.

102
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:49,242
Simply because we want to put it into our function w in the second component and then it should be well-defined.

103
00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:54,407
Ok, there we have it. Solution means it fulfills this equation here.

104
00:09:54,714 --> 00:10:06,152
More concretely the derivative of alpha at the point t is equal to w(t, alpha(t)).

105
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:14,155
So there you see this is a well-defined equation of vectors and it should be fulfilled for all t in the interval.

106
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:18,969
So you see, now we can check this condition here pointwisely

107
00:10:19,343 --> 00:10:24,716
and most importantly you should see the solution is always a differentiable function.

108
00:10:25,371 --> 00:10:32,336
Ok, so we have a lot of definitions here. Therefore let's close the video now with a concrete example.

109
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:38,882
So this one should be very helpful to see what it really means to be a solution for an ODE

110
00:10:39,082 --> 00:10:43,314
and for this let's look at a very simple system of ODEs.

111
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:49,487
x_1 dot should be equal to x_2 and x_2 dot should be equal to -x_1.

112
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:54,787
So you see this is a well-defined system for n=2

113
00:10:54,987 --> 00:11:00,463
and moreover we don't have a problem with the domain of definition. U is simply R^2

114
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:06,822
and then the function w(t, x) is equal to x_2, -x_1.

115
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:11,951
So you see w does not explicitly depend on t,

116
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:17,927
but please don't forget t comes in again if you put in the solution alpha(t).

117
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:23,614
Ok, so now if you look at a system, maybe you immediately see a solution.

118
00:11:23,814 --> 00:11:29,256
Indeed, I know sine and cosine functions fulfill something like that.

119
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:35,923
In fact alpha(t) = (sin(t), cos(t)) does the job.

120
00:11:36,243 --> 00:11:44,287
Simply because we know the derivative of sine is the cosine and the derivative of the cosine is the -sine function.

121
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:49,578
Hence we immediately have a solution of this system of ODEs

122
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,173
and know what one can do is to sketch the solution as its image.

123
00:11:55,629 --> 00:12:00,969
So we know the image of the solution lives in U, which is R^2 in this case

124
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:08,893
and now we can sketch what happens to alpha(t) when we start at t=0 and then increase t.

125
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:13,923
In fact you see what we get is a nice circle with radius 1.

126
00:12:14,357 --> 00:12:14,388
.

127
00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:20,970
Moreover now you can remember this image of the solution is called the orbit of the solution.

128
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:28,331
Indeed it's a dynamic picture that tells us what happens to the solution in the time variable t.

129
00:12:28,657 --> 00:12:33,592
Moreover now you should also see that we easily find a second solution here.

130
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:42,728
Namely if we scale the vector by 1/2 and call the solution alpha tilde, then we see the ODE is also fulfilled

131
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:47,826
and there we get that the orbit is a circle with radius 1/2.

132
00:12:48,486 --> 00:12:55,110
Hence our first result here is that a system of ODEs can have a lot of different solutions.

133
00:12:55,786 --> 00:13:00,976
Therefore a question should also be: which solution gives us the correct picture?

134
00:13:01,176 --> 00:13:07,096
Or more precisely maybe we want the solution that goes through some particular points

135
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:14,966
and there we immediately have the questions: Do we have a solution that goes through the points and if we have it, is it unique?

136
00:13:15,657 --> 00:13:19,813
and exactly these questions we want to answer in this video course.

137
00:13:20,314 --> 00:13:27,103
Therefore I hope that you are not scared off by all these definitions and come back to the next video.

138
00:13:27,303 --> 00:13:33,742
There we will make more geometric pictures, such that you can understand the theory visually.

139
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:37,800
So I hope we meet again and have a nice day. Bye!
