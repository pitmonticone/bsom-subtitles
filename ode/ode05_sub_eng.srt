00:00:00,443 --> 00:00:04,633
Hello and welcome back to ODEs.

2
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:09,787
The video series where we solve such equations and talk about the theory behind it.

3
00:00:09,987 --> 00:00:16,101
Indeed in today's part 5 we will talk about solving strategies for autonomous equations.

4
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:21,886
More precisely we will have a first order, autonomous ODE in one dimension

5
00:00:22,214 --> 00:00:27,589
and in fact it turns out that we have a general solving method for these equations.

6
00:00:28,214 --> 00:00:36,106
However before we start with the details, I first want to thank all the nice people who support this channel on Steady, via PayPal or by other means

7
00:00:36,743 --> 00:00:43,418
and you might already know, as a reward for supporting me you get PDF versions and quizzes for all the videos.

8
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:49,583
Just use the link in the description to find my web page and there you can download everything.

9
00:00:50,257 --> 00:00:54,029
Ok, then without further ado let's start with the topic of today

10
00:00:54,043 --> 00:00:58,833
by first discussing what we mean, when we talk about an initial value problem.

11
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:07,323
The name already tells you, we want to find some special solutions for a differential equation that satisfies some initial condition.

12
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:12,686
More concretely it means, first we have our first order differential equation

13
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:19,705
given as "x dot" is equal to v(x), where v should be a continuous function.

14
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:25,851
We already talked about that this is the general form of ODEs, like  we want to consider them.

15
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:29,697
However now we want to restrict that to one dimension.

16
00:01:29,897 --> 00:01:35,304
In other words it's not a system, it's just one ODE

17
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:42,428
and to make it simpler, the function v should be defined on the whole real number line and a continuous function

18
00:01:42,886 --> 00:01:50,743
and now the initial value is stated as: x at the position 0 is equal to a given value x_0.

19
00:01:51,386 --> 00:01:55,973
So you see x_0 here is just a given real number

20
00:01:56,173 --> 00:02:02,363
and now solving this initial value problem means that we want to find all solutions alpha

21
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:11,384
and such a solution could be defined on any interval (t_0, t_1), but it's important that at least the point 0,

22
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:15,210
the point in time 0 lies inside this interval.

23
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:23,378
Now, as a reminder solutions simply means: if you put the function alpha into the ODE, it solves it.

24
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:32,147
In other words alpha dot(t) is equal to v(alpha(t)) for all t in the interval t_0 to t_1.

25
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:41,856
However for solving the initial value problem we want more. We also want that alpha at the point 0 is equal to x_0.

26
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:46,922
This means that we fix the value of the solution at a given time point

27
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:52,653
and please note that this point is chosen as 0, is not a restriction at all.

28
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:58,325
Simply because we have an autonomous ODE, where the time is not explicitly in it.

29
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:04,363
This means 0 here is an arbitrary choice, but it is without lost of generality.

30
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:11,056
Ok and now the question is: "how can we solve such an ODE with a given initial condition?"

31
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:16,349
and indeed, there is a general solving strategy we now can develop.

32
00:03:16,657 --> 00:03:23,478
However let's first do that in the case that v at our value x_0 is not 0.

33
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,169
In other words this value here should be strictly positive or strictly negative.

34
00:03:29,871 --> 00:03:36,937
We take this case, because there we can simplify the ODE by dividing by v(x).

35
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,029
Hence the ODE now looks like that. x dot divided by v(x) is equal to 1.

36
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:51,714
Please note, because v is a continuous function this whole thing here makes sense in the neighbourhood around x_0.

37
00:03:52,429 --> 00:04:01,380
This means that the function v could have 0 and it would make problems here. However in some sense they are far off, of x_0.

38
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,882
Therefore only around x_0 we consider the ODE in this form.

39
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:17,608
Therefore now we know: any solution alpha here with the condition that 0 is in the domain and alpha(0) = x_0 fulfills the following

40
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:25,020
By definition we have alpha dot(s) divided by v(s) is equal to 1

41
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:33,373
and you already see, we use s as the independent variable here, because we want to use t for something else later.

42
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:39,900
Therefore to make this precise we would say this equation holds for all s in the given interval

43
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:47,215
and now you might already guess. In order to solve this equation now, we will integrate on both sides

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,171
and namely we will simply integrate  from the given point 0 to a given point t.

45
00:04:53,514 --> 00:04:58,325
Hence on the right-hand side it simply means that we get out t.

46
00:04:58,525 --> 00:05:03,593
We integrate a constant from 0 to t. So the result would be t

47
00:05:03,793 --> 00:05:10,982
and now please note, that holds for all possible t and you can also go backwards to the original equation.

48
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:18,705
So you would say this is simply differentiating and then you get the result with the fundamental theorem of calculus.

49
00:05:18,905 --> 00:05:24,871
Indeed, this is a very important result that we need to solve ODEs

50
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:30,900
and if you don't know it, please check out my real analysis series, where we also prove it.

51
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,699
Moreover in real analysis we also learn how to deal with integrals.

52
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:41,585
For example we know we can use the substitution rule to solve such an integral here

53
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,719
and in fact this will be exactly our next step here

54
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:52,525
and there we should immediately see that it helps to introduce a new variable x for alpha(s)

55
00:05:52,725 --> 00:06:02,027
and now by knowing the substitution rule, you know informally that we can write dx = alpha dot(s) ds

56
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:08,791
and then these 2 things here are exactly the 2 things we will substitute here inside the integral.

57
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:13,694
In other words we have the integral of 1 divided by v(x)

58
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:21,070
and then most importantly don't forget the boundaries. Now we integrate from alpha(0) to alpha(t).

59
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:28,270
However we already know alpha(0) is equal to our initial value x_0.

60
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:34,187
Therefore let's immediately pull that in instead of alpha(0) we now write x_0.

61
00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:41,878
Moreover the right-hand side is not changed at all. We still have that this integral is equal to t for all t.

62
00:06:42,078 --> 00:06:52,188
Ok and with that we see in order to solve our original ODE we have to find antiderivatives of the function 1 divided by v.

63
00:06:52,388 --> 00:06:58,033
So again we recognize that the fundamental theorem of calculus goes in here,

64
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:04,397
because from that we can conclude that an integral can be written with antiderivatives.

65
00:07:04,597 --> 00:07:12,557
More precisely we have the antiderivative at the upper limit, alpha(t) - the antiderivative at the lower limit

66
00:07:12,855 --> 00:07:16,935
and in this case we already know this is simply x_0.

67
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:26,960
So there we see we have our new equation here and please don't forget. Capital F should be an antiderivative of the function 1/v.

68
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:34,964
This means that this procedure here only works if we are able to find an antiderivative of the function 1/v.

69
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:40,987
However in the case that we are able to do that, the ODE is almost solved

70
00:07:41,187 --> 00:07:49,271
and maybe in order to see that, let's call F(x_0) just c. So it's just any constant here in this equation.

71
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:54,425
Therefore in our next step let's put this constant to the right-hand side

72
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,218
and then we see the solution we search for, alpha(t), is almost on the left-hand side.

73
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:07,192
In fact we just have to find the inverse of F to isolate alpha(t)

74
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:14,216
and there I can already tell you this is always possible by our assumption around our value x_0.

75
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:20,466
In other words locally we don't have a problem finding an inverse function of F

76
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:25,527
and in conclusion that is all we need for solving our ODE.

77
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:31,124
So on the right we simply have F inverse of t minus our constant c.

78
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:36,899
So in summary we can say we find a solution of our ODE by doing that

79
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:42,972
and then we simply have to adjust the constant such that our initial value is also satisfied

80
00:08:43,714 --> 00:08:50,586
and with that we have it. This is the whole procedure of solving an autonomous ODE of first order.

81
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:59,181
Now, of course the problem is that this looks theoretical. So I want to show you 2 examples and how we can apply this procedure

82
00:08:59,557 --> 00:09:04,343
and there we will also see that you don't have to memorize the procedure from above.

83
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:07,103
You simply have to know what to do in the calculation.

84
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:13,717
Now let's say we have the ODE x dot is equal to lambda times x, with a positive lambda

85
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:18,611
and then for the initial condition we assume that x_0 is not 0,

86
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:23,039
because in this case we can use our procedure from above.

87
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:31,164
Ok and in this point I want to show you an informal step that helps you to memorize the procedure from above.

88
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:39,140
So we rewrite the derivative x dot as dx/dt and then we informally multiply with dt.

89
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:45,006
It seems strange, but it brings us to the correct form, we have already justified above.

90
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:51,765
So the idea is to bring everything with x to the left-hand side and everything with t to the right-hand side.

91
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:56,433
In other words we have lambda times dt on the right-hand side now

92
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:01,351
and then we simply write an integral sign on both sides,

93
00:10:01,743 --> 00:10:06,037
because then the separated dx and dt makes sense again

94
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:13,476
and then you should see on the left this is just a short notation for the antiderivative of 1/v.

95
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,106
Of course not completely, because the constant we already put on the other side.

96
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:27,173
However of course this is not a problem, because we already know on the right-hand side we just have t with a constant anyway.

97
00:10:27,914 --> 00:10:34,151
Ok and now this equation says we have to write antiderivatives on the left-hand side and on the right hand side

98
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:41,557
and the antiderivative of 1/x is given by the natural logarithm of the absolute value of x

99
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:46,638
and on the right hand side we just have lambda as t, as we already know it.

100
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:55,031
However please don't forget, before there was a constant involved, because of the value of the antiderivative at x_0.

101
00:10:55,514 --> 00:11:00,584
In fact different antiderivatives only differ by an additive constant.

102
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:07,194
This means we can just deal with that fact by adding a constant here in the equation.

103
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:15,969
I call it capital C and the idea as before is that we find the correct constant such that our initial value is satisfied.

104
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:21,686
So that's what you should see. It does not matter if we use this -c here or this +C here.

105
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:25,928
It's all the same. We just have to find the correct constant in the end

106
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:31,194
and usually we just shift that problem to the end of the whole calculation.

107
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:38,277
Ok and then you already know in the next step we have to apply the inverse function of the natural logarithm here

108
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,158
and there you should know this is given by the exponential function.

109
00:11:43,914 --> 00:11:49,202
So we have e to the power lambda times t, times e to the power of constant C

110
00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:55,598
and of course this x in the left-hand side here should now be our solution alpha(t).

111
00:11:55,798 --> 00:12:00,127
So in order to make that clear now we should also use this notation

112
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:04,802
and then you see the only thing that remains is that we have an absolute value here.

113
00:12:05,002 --> 00:12:09,608
Which means either we have +the right-hand side or -the right-hand side

114
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:14,721
and with these 2 cases we have solved our initial value problem.

115
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:18,170
So please note, e of something is always positive.

116
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:23,385
So either we have a completely negative solution or a function that is always positive

117
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:32,955
and now by putting in t is equal to 0 to find our x_0, we also get that this constant in front should be x_0.

118
00:12:33,155 --> 00:12:40,646
In other words the solution is then very short. It's simply x_0 times exponential function of lambda times t.

119
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:45,686
Now, this whole thing here is a standard, but also a very important example

120
00:12:45,814 --> 00:12:49,900
and you see, now we have found all the solutions in this form.

121
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:55,565
So for this example we can also say something about the uniqueness of solutions.

122
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,173
So this is already very good, but of course in general we will talk about this issue later.

123
00:13:02,843 --> 00:13:08,628
First here I want to show you another example. Namely x dot is equal to x squared

124
00:13:08,828 --> 00:13:14,960
and as before our initial condition is given as x_0 not equal to 0

125
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:21,318
and now as we have learned before we can do exactly the same steps as in the example above.

126
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:27,390
Indeed, we already know this whole separation idea gives us the correct form in the end.

127
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:35,164
So on the left we have dx/x^2 and on the right we just have dt

128
00:13:35,686 --> 00:13:41,039
and now as before we write an integral to get antiderivatives into the game.

129
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:50,527
So the antiderivative on the left hand side is just -1/x and on the right-hand side it's just t as always.

130
00:13:50,727 --> 00:13:59,186
However as before, please don't forget to add a constant, because this is needed to actually solve our initial value problem

131
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:05,640
or to put it in other words we want to find a general form of the solution and now just 1 particular solution.

132
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:10,233
Therefore please in this step never forget the constant!

133
00:14:10,971 --> 00:14:18,098
Ok and now as before in order to make it consistent with our notation, let's use alpha(t) now instead of just x

134
00:14:18,957 --> 00:14:25,973
and then in the next step we just have to take the inverse here, to get alpha(t) on the left-hand side alone.

135
00:14:26,386 --> 00:14:33,410
Now this is not hard to see. How solution alpha(t) is -1/(t+C).

136
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:43,495
So this is the general form of the solution and now we just have to find what the constant C is, in order to satisfy our initial value.

137
00:14:43,695 --> 00:14:48,701
So this is no problem at all. We simply put in 0, into our form here

138
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:54,209
and then we see we have -1/C

139
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:59,168
and now we know by our initial value problem that this should be equal to x_0.

140
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:03,752
Hence we have an equation that we can solve for C

141
00:15:03,952 --> 00:15:09,886
and this is not a problem at all. C is simply given by -1/x_0

142
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:16,124
and that's exactly the thing we have to put into our general form here

143
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:22,274
and then indeed, we can state the solution of our initial value problem here.

144
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:30,476
So it's alpha(t) is equal to -1/(t+(-1/x_0)

145
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,350
and now of course we can simplify that by expanding the fraction.

146
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:41,933
There we have x_0/(1-x_0 times t)

147
00:15:42,586 --> 00:15:47,646
and there you see this is the solution. We have solved our initial value problem.
