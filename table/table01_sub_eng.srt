Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,639
This is a quick video about a table you really should remember.

3
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:17,282
In the first row I give you an angle and we start with 0°, go to 30°, then to 45°, 60° and 90°.

4
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:28,617
Of course we can also do this in radians. So we have 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3 and pi/2.

5
00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:33,869
Now, let's take the function sine and calculate the values of these angles.

6
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:40,146
The sin(0) is 0, but let's write it as 1/2 times sqrt(0).

7
00:00:40,346 --> 00:00:44,510
The next value then reads 1/2 times the root of 1

8
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,645
and then we can continue to 1/2 * sqrt(2),

9
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:53,976
1/2 * sqrt(3) and 1/2 * sqrt(4).

10
00:00:54,176 --> 00:00:59,892
Of course we could simplify these values here and obviously in calculations we should really do this,

11
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:03,749
but here it's much easier to remember the table in this way.

12
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:08,971
Now then the next nice thing is, it works for the cosine as well. Just the other way around.

13
00:01:09,114 --> 00:01:15,790
We have 1/2*sqrt(4) for 0 and for pi/6 we have 1/2*sqrt(3),

14
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,705
then 1/2*sqrt(2). The same as for the sine

15
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:27,161
and 1/2*sqrt(1) for 60° and 1/2*sqrt(0) for 90°

16
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:32,102
and there we have it. This is the table you should remember and never forget.

17
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:39,265
Essentially you just have to remember these 5 angles here, because then you can fill out this whole table in your mind.

18
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:43,314
I hope this helps and see you next time. Bye!
