Hello and welcome to Manifolds, a video series 
I started for everyone who wants to learn how  

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,240
to use calculus on surfaces and related topics. 
However, before we start I really want to thank  

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,160
all the nice people who support this channel 
on Steady, via Paypal, or by other means.  

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,760
Now, in part 1 of the course, I give you a short 
overview and explain the definition of a topology. 

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,280
So let's start with a quick explanation what we 
will discuss in this course. First, as I've already  

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:40,880
mentioned, the notion of a manifold generalizes the 
concept of a surface in space. Such a surface we  

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:47,360
could visualize like this but the most popular 
one would be the two-dimensional sphere.  

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,880
So this is the boundary of the ball and often called 
S^2.  The 2 stands for the two dimensions we have  

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,040
when we just live on the surface. Now you might 
already know some important applications where  

10
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:08,800
it is needed to calculate on the sphere. Especially
in physics, it happens that some constraints force  

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:16,400
the motion to happen on the surface. Then questions 
like finding a minimum or a maximum of a function  

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,520
are completely different because we can't 
use our calculus for open domains anymore.

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,240
Therefore the overall question here will 
be how to extend our calculation rules for  

14
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:35,200
surfaces and indeed abstract manifolds. In order 
to do this we first have to understand what the  

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,160
fundamentals of such a surface are. So we start 
with a quick overview of the field of topology.

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,240
Afterwards we will be able to define 
differentiable manifolds as our subject of  

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:56,240
study. So you see the notion of differentiability 
will be a crucial point in this course. Then next  

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,280
for these differentiable manifolds we will be able 
to define so-called differential forms. At first  

19
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,360
glance these differential forms might look strange 
because they are just given by one part of an  

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:18,080
integral like dx or d omega. However we will 
define these objects in a rigorous way and indeed,  

21
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:26,000
in the end, also integrals with these differential 
forms will make sense. Okay now the overall goal  

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,800
I have in mind for this course here is that we 
will reach the generalized Stokes's theorem. Indeed  

23
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,200
this theorem will nicely form a connection between 
a manifold and its boundary by using differential  

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:46,160
form. So this is the overview of the course and 
i think we are ready to start with the first part  

25
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,960
and talk about topology. Now if you already have 
a good knowledge of metric spaces you can use  

26
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:59,840
this as a starting point. Indeed a lot of notions 
we have in topology are already formulated  

27
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:07,040
in metric spaces. Here please recall: a metric 
space needs a set X and a distance function d.  

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,360
This means when we have to set X we can 
measure distances between two points in X  

29
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,280
for example here x and y have a 
distance given by a positive real number  

30
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:27,040
and this one is denoted by d(x,y). Now in the 
case you see this the first time you can watch  

31
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,320
the first videos in my functional analysis 
course to get familiar with metric spaces  

32
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,000
however the important thing here is that you 
know how we can define open sets usually this  

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,760
works when we take so called open epsilon 
balls. This means that B_epsilon(x) is a ball  

34
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:55,760
with radius epsilon and middle point x. Now by 
using these epsilon balls we can say if a subset  

35
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:04,320
in the metric space is open. Hence here the notion 
"open" for a subset depends on the chosen metric d. 

36
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,840
But then we can show that the collection of 
all open sets fulfills some nice properties. 

37
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:19,280
For example if we take two open sets the intersection 
is always also an open set with such properties  

38
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,960
in mind we see that for a lot of things we 
do not need an explicit measure of distance  

39
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:32,400
just some neighborhood relation between the points 
might be sufficient so roughly speaking we just  

40
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,800
need to know which points are neighbors of x are 
close to x without measuring the explicit distance  

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,920
indeed the abstraction of 
this idea leads to topology  

42
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,640
hence we just list all the sets that should be 
open and then we deduce everything from them  

43
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,840
most importantly in this definition 
we don't need a metric anymore  

44
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:04,720
however of course we still have a set X then what 
we need is the collection of all subsets of X 

45
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,920
which we call the power set of X and denote 
by P(X) therefore to say which sets are open  

46
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:18,240
we just have to take a subset of the power 
set and this one is denoted by a curved T

47
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,720
in other words this T just stands for a collection 
of subsets of X now these subsets should be the  

48
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,680
open sets therefore they have to fulfill all the 
rules like in the metric space indeed we will  

49
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,400
fix three important properties here now the first 
one is very simple we just say that the empty set  

50
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:47,120
and the whole space X are open sets. More 
precisely they are elements of the collection T

51
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,360
then the second property I already 
mentioned. If we take two open sets A and B

52
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:02,480
then this implies that the intersection is also 
an open set finally the third and last property  

53
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:09,600
looks similarly but now for the union however you 
might know in a metric space with the union and  

54
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,320
open sets we can do a lot. What I mean is it does 
not matter how many open sets are in the union  

55
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:24,080
the result is always an open set as well hence 
here we can look at the whole family of open sets  

56
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,680
so we look at A_i where i goes through any 
fixed index set capital I and of course  

57
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,160
any subset in the family is an element of 
t and then this implies that we can look at  

58
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:45,920
the big union i in i of the sets A_i and we 
conclude this union is also an element in T

59
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,400
okay and there you see we condense the 
properties of open sets for a metric space

60
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,960
into a new definition. Indeed with this definition 
we can work and we don't need a metric anymore  

61
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:06,720
what we now have is a collection of subsets T 
and we call it a topology on X and I already  

62
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:14,400
mentioned it a lot the elements of a topology are 
called open sets therefore please always remember  

63
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,600
in the topology the property open is given by 
definition and therefore open only makes sense  

64
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:28,720
with respect to a chosen topology. OK, I think it 
will be very helpful when we look at some examples  

65
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:36,720
therefore let's start with the easiest examples so 
the question is what is the simplest choice for T  

66
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,160
such that all the rules are fulfilled. Of
course in order to satisfy the first rule  

67
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,880
we need at least the empty set and X involved 
however if we leave it at that we already have  

68
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:55,680
a topology so what you should see is the second 
and the third property are immediately satisfied  

69
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,240
simply because there are not many choices 
for the intersection and the union  

70
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:07,040
hence this means that this is the topology 
where all the non-trivial subsets are not open  

71
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,400
so maybe not the most interesting topology 
to work with ok now you might already know  

72
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,200
we can also do the other extreme which means we 
have the topology where all the subsets are open  

73
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,240
of course the power set of X is a topology 
on X because there's no way to violate one  

74
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,680
of these rules the power set just contains 
all the subsets and now in this topology all  

75
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,400
these subsets are open sets, therefore 
we often call it the discrete topology.

76
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:48,000
On the other hand the first example is often 
called the indiscrete topology. Of course both  

77
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,120
examples are not the most interesting topologies 
but they are edge cases you should always have  

78
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,800
in mind. Okay maybe that's good enough for the 
introduction today. Let's continue in the next  

79
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:07,840
video while working with the open sets. Therefore 
I hope I see you there and have a nice day. Bye!

80
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,060
