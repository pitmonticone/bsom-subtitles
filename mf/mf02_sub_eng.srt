00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,630
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,779
 manifolds.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,730
 And before we start, I want

4
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,079
 to thank all the nice people

5
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,119
 who support this channel

6
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,829
 and Steady via paypal or by

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,479
 other means.

8
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,560
 Now, in today's part two,

9
00:00:12,569 --> 00:00:14,100
 we continue talking about

10
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:15,640
 the topic of topology,

11
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,129
 namely, we introduce notions

12
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:19,870
 like interior, closure

13
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:21,110
 and related stuff

14
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:22,379
 for this

15
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:23,809
 Please recall that the

16
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:25,750
 topology on a set X is a

17
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,700
 collection of subsets that

18
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:29,600
 satisfies three rules.

19
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,979
 First, the smallest and the

20
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:33,700
 largest subset have to be

21
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:34,360
 involved.

22
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,900
 Secondly, you cannot leave

23
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:38,860
 the topology by finitely many

24
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:39,919
 intersections.

25
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:42,349
 And thirdly, you also cannot

26
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,279
 leave it with any unions.

27
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,020
 So these are the three properties

28
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:48,979
 of a topology T and you

29
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,599
 also should remember that

30
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,439
 the elements of T are called

31
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,380
 open sets.

32
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:56,169
 Moreover, the set X

33
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,169
 together with a chosen topology

34
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,610
 is called a topological

35
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:00,240
 space.

36
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:02,700
 Hence, it's a space where

37
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:04,540
 the notion of open sets makes

38
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,050
 sense.

39
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:07,699
 Of course, we will also discuss

40
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:09,180
 examples of topological

41
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,150
 spaces here.

42
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:12,660
 However, before we do this,

43
00:01:12,669 --> 00:01:14,019
 we first need more

44
00:01:14,029 --> 00:01:14,860
 definitions.

45
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,300
 Indeed, in a topological

46
00:01:17,309 --> 00:01:19,220
 space points in X

47
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,739
 can have special names.

48
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:22,970
 Therefore, here let's fix

49
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,139
 a topological space

50
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,529
 (X,T) and a

51
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,389
 subset S in X

52
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,000
 here, please note S could

53
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,750
 be an element of the topology

54
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,260
 but it does not have to be

55
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,510
 OK.

56
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,910
 We want to talk about names

57
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:36,709
 for points.

58
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,559
 So let's fix the point P

59
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:39,430
 in X.

60
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,830
 Now all the names we give

61
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:43,790
 for P are to be read with

62
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,339
 respect to the fix set

63
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:45,989
 S.

64
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,430
 Therefore, our visualization

65
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,529
 should look like this.

66
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,269
 We have the whole space X

67
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:53,330
 and inside we have the

68
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:54,519
 subset S

69
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:56,889
 then one possibility for

70
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,489
 P is that P is an

71
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,830
 element of S.

72
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,339
 Of course, this alone is

73
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:04,050
 not so interesting, but we

74
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:05,269
 could have even more.

75
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:08,050
 And then we talk of an interior

76
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:09,169
 point of S.

77
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:11,830
 So what this exactly means

78
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:13,309
 we can now define

79
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:15,690
 indeed what we need is an

80
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:17,570
 open set and maybe let's

81
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,770
 call it U here.

82
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,119
 Now this open set should

83
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,910
 contain the point P and it

84
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,639
 should also lie completely

85
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:26,110
 inside the set S

86
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,440
 and if we have these two

87
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,339
 properties, we call P

88
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,059
 an interior point of S.

89
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,750
 So you see the crucial thing

90
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,750
 here is that we find a suitable

91
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,490
 open set from the topology

92
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,119
 T OK.

93
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,279
 Now, it might not surprise

94
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:42,990
 you when we have interior

95
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,759
 points of S, we also

96
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,660
 have exterior points of S.

97
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,649
 Of course, the name

98
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,369
 suggests in our picture

99
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,080
 here, the point P should

100
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,690
 lie outside of S.

101
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,449
 However, as before we

102
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,919
 want to lie outside,

103
00:02:57,929 --> 00:02:59,860
 even with an open set U.

104
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:02,289
 So visually speaking, we

105
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,809
 want some distance in both

106
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,500
 cases from the boundary of

107
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,929
 S.

108
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,300
 Hence, we need an open set

109
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:09,899
 U such that there's no

110
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,300
 overlap with S.

111
00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:14,320
 Therefore, this exactly means

112
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,110
 that P is an interior

113
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:17,679
 point of the complement of

114
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,630
 S or with the same

115
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,389
 formula as before we find

116
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:23,149
 an open set U such that

117
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,940
 P is an element of U

118
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:26,830
 and U is a subset of X

119
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,830
 without S

120
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,300
 OK.

121
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,679
 Now we have two important

122
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,419
 terms here.

123
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:33,020
 And you see in our picture,

124
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,339
 we have described all the

125
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,240
 points inside the set S

126
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,300
 and all outside of S.

127
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:41,100
 Therefore, the points missing

128
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,860
 are the ones on the boundary

129
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:43,509
 of S.

130
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,490
 For this reason, we could

131
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,369
 define P to be a boundary

132
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,899
 point of S if it's

133
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,660
 neither an interior point

134
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:52,380
 nor an exterior point.

135
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:54,660
 However, of course, we can

136
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,300
 also immediately describe

137
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:57,960
 this with opens set

138
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,750
 U. It

139
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,199
 simply means that no matter

140
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,050
 which opens set you, we choose,

141
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:04,690
 we always have an overlap

142
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:06,550
 with S and the complement

143
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:07,110
 of S.

144
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:09,779
 Hence, we can write for all

145
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:11,320
 open sets U with the

146
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,080
 property that P is an element

147
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:13,820
 of U.

148
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:15,779
 We have U

149
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,190
 intersected with S is non-

150
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,750
 empty and U

151
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,519
 intersected with X without

152
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:22,399
 S is also non-empty.

153
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:24,980
 Then such a point P with

154
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:26,720
 this property, we call a

155
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,390
 boundary point of S.

156
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:29,660
 OK.

157
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,690
 Now, you might think that

158
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,339
 we have all the names, but

159
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,540
 I still want to include a

160
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:34,410
 last one.

161
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,679
 Indeed, this one is often

162
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,799
 important when we want to

163
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:39,320
 deal with limits and it's

164
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:41,000
 called accumulation point

165
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,269
 of the set S.

166
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:44,390
 And it simply means that

167
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,079
 the point P is not

168
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:47,630
 isolated from the rest of

169
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,500
 the set S.

170
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,220
 Hence, as before, we can

171
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,850
 describe this, when we look

172
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,739
 at all open sets U that

173
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,140
 contain the point P

174
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:58,799
 and then we want that something

175
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:00,480
 from the set S remains.

176
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,049
 Or in other words, the intersection

177
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:04,570
 with the set S should not

178
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:05,750
 be the empty set

179
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:07,140
 Here,

180
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:08,540
 the crucial thing is that

181
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:10,140
 this works no matter which

182
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:12,029
 open set U around P

183
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,660
 we choose.

184
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:14,910
 For this reason, you immediately

185
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,890
 see an exterior point

186
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,489
 can never be an accumulation

187
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:18,929
 point.

188
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,440
 OK.

189
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,160
 So here we have four important

190
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,019
 names for points that are

191
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:25,410
 defined with respect to a

192
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,700
 chosen subset

193
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:27,000
 S.

194
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,750
 Therefore, I would say please

195
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,589
 remember them.

196
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:32,820
 However, now we're having

197
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:34,589
 these names for points, we

198
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,239
 are also able to define

199
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,480
 names for sets.

200
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:39,959
 But don't worry, these are

201
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,450
 not complicated anymore.

202
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:43,760
 For example, for the set

203
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:45,450
 S, we can define

204
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:46,559
 S circle.

205
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:48,910
 This one is simply the collection

206
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,790
 of all points P in X

207
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,730
 that fulfill that P is an

208
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:54,339
 interior point of S.

209
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,980
 Therefore, S circle is

210
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,730
 called the interior of

211
00:05:58,739 --> 00:05:59,250
 S.

212
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,959
 So the interior is defined

213
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,540
 for a subset and it gives

214
00:06:03,549 --> 00:06:04,940
 us a new subset.

215
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:07,309
 And now it might not surprise

216
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,869
 you that we can do a similar

217
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,459
 thing for all the other points

218
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:10,769
 here.

219
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,630
 Hence, the next thing will

220
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,359
 be the exterior of S

221
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,519
 However, there, we don't

222
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:18,720
 have a special symbol.

223
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,429
 We just write Ext of

224
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,250
 S, then we

225
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,529
 collect all the exterior

226
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,290
 points of S and call this

227
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:26,929
 set the exterior of

228
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,790
 S. OK.

229
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,549
 The next important subset

230
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,429
 will be the boundary of S.

231
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,010
 Indeed, this one is denoted

232
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,570
 with a curved lowercase

233
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:37,019
 d.

234
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,459
 It's the same symbol we would

235
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,820
 also use for partial

236
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:41,670
 derivatives.

237
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,220
 However, here, dS denotes

238
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,959
 a whole set namely the

239
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,269
 one with all the boundary

240
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,190
 points of S.

241
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,649
 And not so surprising, this

242
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,040
 one is called the boundary

243
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:52,709
 of S.

244
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,859
 Hence, only one set

245
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:56,619
 remains the one about the

246
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,880
 accumulation points.

247
00:06:58,579 --> 00:06:59,850
 And for this one, we have

248
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:01,359
 a rather strange notation,

249
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:02,920
 we call it S prime.

250
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,250
 Therefore, for a set, the

251
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,940
 line in the upper index means

252
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,500
 that we have all the accumulation

253
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,660
 points in the set.

254
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:12,049
 In fact, one often calls

255
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:13,720
 this the derivative of the

256
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,570
 set S.

257
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,640
 Another term we will use

258
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:17,970
 here is that this is the

259
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,649
 derived set of S.

260
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,959
 Now I would say what you

261
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,489
 should see here is that we

262
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,859
 have a lot of labels, you

263
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:26,130
 should know when doing

264
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,959
 topology.

265
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:28,809
 Actually, there are even

266
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,970
 more than just the four I

267
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,880
 showed you here.

268
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:32,630
 And the last one I really

269
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,309
 need to show you.

270
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,859
 Now, it's an

271
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:35,769
 important one.

272
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,290
 It's called the closure of

273
00:07:37,299 --> 00:07:37,799
 S.

274
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,660
 And you see it has a nice

275
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,630
 notation, we just overline

276
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,179
 the set.

277
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:44,179
 Now, the definition is not

278
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,880
 so complicated, we just take

279
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,839
 the original set S and then

280
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,279
 take the union with the

281
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,970
 boundary and

282
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,820
 then the set is what we call

283
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:54,209
 the closure of S.

284
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,850
 So I already told you this

285
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:58,179
 is the last definition I

286
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,500
 want to show you today

287
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,119
 at this point.

288
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,679
 I really think it's helpful

289
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,079
 to look at an example.

290
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,279
 So let's take an example

291
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,070
 of a topology which is not

292
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:08,649
 so common.

293
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,160
 However, the set X can be

294
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:11,959
 very common.

295
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,519
 So let's take the real number

296
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:13,920
 line.

297
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,459
 On the other hand, T should

298
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,230
 not be the standard topology.

299
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:19,570
 So let's define it in the

300
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:20,369
 following way.

301
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:23,170
 First, we already know the

302
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:24,890
 empty set and the real number

303
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:26,329
 line should be included in

304
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,130
 the topology.

305
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:29,660
 However, all the other

306
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,410
 open sets should be half-

307
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,700
 bounded intervals.

308
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,400
 Therefore, each non-trivial

309
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:36,900
 open set is such an

310
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,229
 interval that starts with

311
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:39,840
 a real number a and goes

312
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:40,580
 to infinity

313
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:41,940
 here.

314
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,419
 Please note it's important

315
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,830
 that the left boundary a

316
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,780
 here is not included in the

317
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:47,380
 interval.

318
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,530
 Now, it's a good exercise

319
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:51,260
 for you to check that all

320
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,039
 the three rules of a topology

321
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:54,049
 are fulfilled here.

322
00:08:54,979 --> 00:08:56,400
 Then with this knowledge,

323
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:58,349
 we can take a subset S and

324
00:08:58,359 --> 00:08:59,900
 look at the sets we defined

325
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:00,440
 above.

326
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:03,119
 In fact, the subset si have

327
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,869
 in mind is the interval

328
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,150
 0 to 1.

329
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:09,159
 Also here, the zero and

330
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:10,989
 one are not included in the

331
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,390
 set.

332
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,760
 Now, the first thing we can

333
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,539
 note here is that this set

334
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:16,700
 is not open.

335
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,409
 So maybe you find it strange

336
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:20,289
 to say this.

337
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:22,010
 But you immediately see this

338
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,900
 set is not included in our

339
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:25,450
 collection of open sets.

340
00:09:26,469 --> 00:09:28,349
 It's simply not such an interval

341
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:28,609
 here.

342
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:30,820
 Therefore, the next thing

343
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,530
 we can see here is that S

344
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,309
 has no interior points at

345
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,659
 all.

346
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,719
 This is simply because we

347
00:09:36,729 --> 00:09:38,280
 don't find any non-

348
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,150
 empty open subset that

349
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,630
 lies inside the set.

350
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,460
 S. Here,

351
00:09:43,469 --> 00:09:45,030
 Please recall, we need at

352
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,820
 least one such U with

353
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,359
 this property to have

354
00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:49,530
 interior points.

355
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,080
 In other words, we can't

356
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,669
 fit an unbounded interval

357
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,250
 into this interval here.

358
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,929
 And therefore, the interior

359
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,900
 of S is the empty set.

360
00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:01,270
 OK.

361
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:03,030
 Now you might ask, what can

362
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,520
 we say about the exterior

363
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,039
 points?

364
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,250
 And there, you know, we have

365
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,789
 to look at X without

366
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,309
 S.

367
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:11,919
 So the complement of S which

368
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:13,650
 is simply the interval for

369
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:15,030
 minus infinity

370
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,369
 to zero and then the

371
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,030
 union of the interval

372
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,830
 from one to infinity.

373
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,780
 So there you see this is

374
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,419
 better for this set.

375
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:27,380
 We find open sets that

376
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,869
 are contained in this one

377
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,349
 more concretely, this works

378
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:32,940
 for all points except

379
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,849
 one here in the second part.

380
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,650
 Therefore, the exterior of

381
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:39,030
 S is simply the

382
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,570
 interval from one to

383
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,330
 infinity.

384
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:42,890
 OK.

385
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,929
 Now, with the knowledge of

386
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,489
 these two sets, we

387
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,869
 immediately know all the

388
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,400
 boundary points of S

389
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,609
 there.

390
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:51,320
 Please recall these are all

391
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,690
 the points in X that are

392
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,289
 neither in the interior of

393
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:56,250
 S nor in the exterior

394
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:56,969
 of S.

395
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:59,409
 Hence, it's the interval

396
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:01,359
 from minus infinity to

397
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,770
 one including the

398
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,489
 point 1.

399
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:05,820
 Again, this might look

400
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,380
 strange, but it is simply

401
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,950
 because our topology is

402
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,130
 chosen in this way,

403
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:12,530
 all open sets stretch from

404
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,969
 one point to plus

405
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:14,799
 infinity.

406
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:16,580
 So they can't see what happens

407
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,770
 in the other direction to

408
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,840
 minus infinity.

409
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,940
 And therefore we have the

410
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,659
 conclusion that the boundary

411
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:24,500
 of this set is everything

412
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,659
 on the left hand side.

413
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:27,109
 OK.

414
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,369
 And in order to close this

415
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,890
 example here, now we can

416
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,169
 also say that the closure

417
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:33,080
 of S is exactly the same

418
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,450
 set.

419
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,919
 So you see this here is a

420
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,750
 nice example in order to

421
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,380
 get used to topologies

422
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:41,950
 and please never forget all

423
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,369
 the notions we have here

424
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,070
 always depend on the chosen

425
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,799
 topology.

426
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,460
 Then I would say let's go

427
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:49,900
 deeper into the field with

428
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,099
 the next videos.

429
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:53,169
 Therefore, I hope I see you

430
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,679
 there and have a nice day.

431
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,520
 Bye.
