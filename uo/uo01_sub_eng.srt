00:00:00,357 --> 00:00:05,460
Hello and welcome to the video series about unbounded operators.

2
00:00:05,843 --> 00:00:13,261
This is a video course in the field of functional analysis and I would say it's already very special and advanced.

3
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:21,984
Therefore in order to understand this course in the best way, you should already have good knowledge in linear algebra and real analysis

4
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:27,933
and of course you can always refresh your memory by watching my videos about these topics

5
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:35,048
and moreover if you watched my functional analysis course, you already learned a lot about bounded operators.

6
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:42,747
This means this course here expands the functional analysis course by so called unbounded operators.

7
00:00:43,157 --> 00:00:50,418
Now indeed it turns out that these operators are not easy to describe, but they occur a lot in applications.

8
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:53,652
However, before I start with the motivation here,

9
00:00:53,852 --> 00:01:00,070
first I really want to thank all the nice people who support this channel on Steady, that made this video course possible.

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,610
Since this is such a special topic, which will not generate many views on YouTube. 

11
00:01:05,743 --> 00:01:09,986
I can only do it, because of your support on Steady or Patreon

12
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:16,196
and as a thank you, you will always find the PDF versions and quizzes for the videos on my Webpage.

13
00:01:17,014 --> 00:01:23,368
Ok, then let's start with the topic and let's clear up why unbounded operators are so important.

14
00:01:23,771 --> 00:01:26,437
In fact we immediately have a mathematical reason,

15
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:32,771
because when we deal with partial differential equations we immediately see unbounded operators.

16
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:41,267
So the whole theory about partial differential equations is much easier to understand when you know what unbounded operators are

17
00:01:41,757 --> 00:01:45,846
and obviously we will explain these connections in this course.

18
00:01:46,214 --> 00:01:50,943
Now, historically the next one might be the biggest motivation after all,

19
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:55,619
because you need unbounded operators to describe quantum mechanics.

20
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,908
So you might already know that in this physical theory you need operators.

21
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:07,756
So you definitely need functional analysis, but it turns out that you can't avoid unbounded operators.

22
00:02:07,956 --> 00:02:14,888
Indeed, one needs 2 special objects as operators and we call them X and P.

23
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:23,761
So for example for one particle the one measures the position of the particle and the other operator measures the momentum of the particle

24
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:30,412
and now the physical reality tells us that the order of these two measurements matters.

25
00:02:30,612 --> 00:02:34,509
This means XP is different from PX

26
00:02:34,943 --> 00:02:41,477
and of course by using functional analysis we can describe this as a composition of operators.

27
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:49,639
However now the order of the composition matters in the sense that the difference is proportional to the identity operator.

28
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:56,097
More precisely we also have the imaginary unit here, but this is not the important part now.

29
00:02:56,297 --> 00:03:02,717
The crucial thing here is that we can not satisfy this equation with just bounded operators.

30
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:09,015
This means we have to extend the notion of a linear operator to do quantum mechanics

31
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:13,787
and in fact we will see that with unbounded operators this works.

32
00:03:14,243 --> 00:03:21,151
However together with the unbounded operators we get other technical difficulties into the theory

33
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:25,627
and we will immediately see this with the first definition here,

34
00:03:25,827 --> 00:03:29,786
but let's first start with some objects we should already know.

35
00:03:29,986 --> 00:03:35,673
Namely the first things we need are two normed spaces we call X and Y.

36
00:03:36,086 --> 00:03:42,150
So we have 2 vector spaces over the same field and they also carry a norm

37
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,846
and you might know we either have real vector spaces or complex ones.

38
00:03:47,046 --> 00:03:52,778
Therefore if we call the field F it's either the real number line or the complex plane

39
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:58,357
and I can already tell you, most of the time you can just thing of complex vector spaces here.

40
00:03:58,929 --> 00:04:06,408
Ok, but now immediately something new arises. Namely we need a domain for our operator

41
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:11,269
and this will be a subspace in X and we call it D.

42
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:16,130
Hence, now the map we consider and call T is a linear one

43
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:21,886
and you can put in elements from the subspace D and you get out elements from Y

44
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:27,856
and now in this course we keep it simple. Such a linear map, we always call an operator.

45
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:35,352
So please keep that in mind. If we talk about unbounded operators, we implicitly mean linear operators.

46
00:04:35,552 --> 00:04:42,200
Ok and now it's a good time to also talk about other notations people use to denote such an operator.

47
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:50,392
Now, the first one is very similar. Some people just use the subset relation here, in the definition of the operator again.

48
00:04:50,592 --> 00:04:55,957
This makes sense, because often the space X is the important normed space here.

49
00:04:56,157 --> 00:05:02,621
However, some other people abuse this notation a little bit by omitting the actual domain here

50
00:05:02,821 --> 00:05:08,015
and if they are nice, they at least say somewhere, that this T has the domain D.

51
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:14,285
So you can recognize with this that some people see an operator as a pair of 2 things.

52
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:20,738
First they say they have an action defined by T and then a restriction to a domain D.

53
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:25,491
So this keeps it very short, but you also often see that in some books.

54
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:30,589
Or similarly instead of a pair, one writes T with domain D,

55
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:35,882
but instead of the word domain, one also often uses D(T).

56
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:43,629
Ok, maybe that's good enough for the different notations you could stumble upon, but let's go back to the actual definition here.

57
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:51,240
Now for this course a very important term will be given by so called densely defined operators

58
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,132
and you might already expect that these will be the operators we will discuss in the next videos

59
00:05:57,786 --> 00:06:04,462
and the definition should be very clear. T is called densely defined, if domain D is dense.

60
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:13,210
More precisely this means if you take the closure in the space X, then you get the full space X out.

61
00:06:13,686 --> 00:06:20,218
So maybe the domain of the operator is not the whole space, but it's very close to that in this sense

62
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:28,623
and here please note, this thing here is only interesting in infinite dimensions, because D is still a linear subspace.

63
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:35,957
So only in infinite dimensions, we could have smaller subspaces that are still dense in the whole space.

64
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:42,424
Ok by knowing that we can also write down 2 important subspaces we use all the time

65
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:47,041
and of course I mean range and kernel for the operator T.

66
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:54,457
So the explicit definitions you might already know, but because we have to consider a domain here, I want to write them down.

67
00:06:54,657 --> 00:07:00,057
Now first the range of T is given by all the elements we hit on the right-hand side.

68
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:04,674
This means we have to go through all lower case x in D

69
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:08,068
and what we get is a subspace in Y.

70
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:12,086
So please remember that. It's still a linear subspace.

71
00:07:12,457 --> 00:07:17,830
Ok and now for the kernel we have to take all the points x that are sent to 0.

72
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,566
Therefore what we get here is a linear subspace in X.

73
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:28,504
Ok and with that we have it. We have the range of the operator T and the kernel of T

74
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:33,838
and now in the next step we can finally recall the definition of boundedness

75
00:07:34,314 --> 00:07:39,917
and then of course if you know what bounded means, you also know what unbounded means.

76
00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:48,863
So now bounded means we find a constant c. Which we could choose greater than 0, but it should be a finite number

77
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:55,909
and now for every point x in the domain we can calculate Tx in the norm of Y

78
00:07:56,109 --> 00:08:00,620
and now this one should always be bounded by the constant c.

79
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:06,115
More precisely it's c times the norm of x in the space X

80
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:13,278
and here you should recognize if you calculate the operator norm you have learned in the functional analysis course,

81
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:17,857
you see this operator norm is bounded by the constant c

82
00:08:18,286 --> 00:08:22,251
and therefore the operator T is called bounded

83
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:27,675
and now if the operator norm is infinite, we call the operator unbounded

84
00:08:28,057 --> 00:08:30,892
or more precisely we can do the negation here.

85
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:41,689
Which means for all constants we find at least one point x such that Tx in the norm is greater than c times x in the norm.

86
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:47,274
This means the ratio Tx to x exceeds every bound

87
00:08:47,886 --> 00:08:53,067
and therefore the operator norm as a number would give infinity in this case.

88
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:59,312
Indeed this can definitely happen and we will see some important examples in the next video.

89
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:05,797
However here I first want to recall an important equivalence from the functional analysis course.

90
00:09:05,997 --> 00:09:13,756
Namely a linear map is bounded if and only if it's continuous at all the points in the domain.

91
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:20,777
So you see for operators the terms boundedness and continuity are connected in this way.

92
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:28,255
Therefore unbounded operators as we want to consider them in this course are not continuous at all.

93
00:09:28,643 --> 00:09:33,915
Indeed, an unbounded operator has to be discontinuous at all points.

94
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:39,758
So this is important to remember. Unbounded means not continuous at all

95
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:46,019
and there we see again, This is definitely something that can only happen in infinite dimensions.

96
00:09:46,357 --> 00:09:52,323
Of course in finite dimensions every linear map has to be a continuous map.

97
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:59,890
However in infinite dimensions we have so many directions that the continuity property can fail

98
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:06,773
and at this point we already know we can not ignore such operators, because they occur in a lot of applications

99
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:13,120
and therefore I would say let's look at some examples in the next video and let's discuss it more.

100
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,100
So have a nice day and bye bye!
