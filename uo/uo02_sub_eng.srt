00:00:00,314 --> 00:00:03,951
Hello and welcome back to unbounded operators.

2
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:08,535
The video series, where we tackle some more topics of functional analysis

3
00:00:08,735 --> 00:00:14,232
and now in today's part 2 we will look at some examples for unbounded operators.

4
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:22,914
However, as always before we start I first want to thank all the nice people who support this channel on Steady, here on YouTube or on Patreon.

5
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:28,038
Ok, then let's start by recalling what we mean by an operator.

6
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:33,909
So you should know, it's just the linear map between 2 normed spaces, X and Y.

7
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:40,194
Moreover, we also say it has a domain D(T) given by a subspace D.

8
00:00:40,394 --> 00:00:45,321
This actually means that we only have a map from D into Y

9
00:00:45,714 --> 00:00:49,506
and please don't forget it's always a linear map.

10
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:55,445
Ok and now such operators here could be either bounded or unbounded

11
00:00:55,486 --> 00:00:58,490
and this we can measure wit the operator norm.

12
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,962
So this we already know. So let's state some other important fact.

13
00:01:03,386 --> 00:01:09,002
Namely we can consider the case that the kernel of our operator is trivial.

14
00:01:09,371 --> 00:01:14,642
This means it's equal to the smallest possible subspace, which is the zero vector.

15
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:19,580
In particular this means that the linear map T is injective

16
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:26,363
and from that we now can conclude that we can write down an inverse map T to the power -1.

17
00:01:26,563 --> 00:01:31,388
Now of course here we change the direction. So now we map Y into X

18
00:01:31,588 --> 00:01:36,379
and we can do that because we can write down a suitable domain

19
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:44,223
and indeed in general the domain is not equal to the whole space Y, but only equal to the range of T.

20
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:51,906
This makes sense because with this restriction here on the right-hand side we would get the surjectivity for our linear map.

21
00:01:52,106 --> 00:02:01,549
So in short what we have learned here is if the kernel of T is trivial, the inverse T^-1 is always defined as an operator.

22
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:10,165
However please note this operator here can be unbounded even in the case that the original operator T was bounded.

23
00:02:10,365 --> 00:02:16,334
Nevertheless you see this makes our lives a little bit simpler for defining operators

24
00:02:16,843 --> 00:02:20,941
and with that I would say we are ready for discussing examples

25
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:28,047
and for the start I want to keep it simple. So let's say that X and Y represent the same normed space

26
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:31,972
and this one should be the space of continuous functions

27
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:38,728
and maybe let's say the continuous functions are only defined on the unit interval 0 to 1

28
00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:46,011
and you might know, the common norm one chooses for this space is the uniform norm, also called the supremum norm

29
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:50,494
and one just uses an infinity symbol to denote this norm.

30
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:54,902
Ok, then let's define an operator that maps X to Y.

31
00:02:55,102 --> 00:03:03,946
So as before we write T from X to Y, but what we actually mean is that T has a domain as a subspace in X

32
00:03:04,146 --> 00:03:12,409
and for this case here, I want to choose the domain as the continuous functions that are also continuously differentiable.

33
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:17,785
So in short I just want to write C^1 as a subspace in C.

34
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:27,006
Because then I can simply write that T applied to an element from the domain is defined as the derivative

35
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:32,508
and if we call the function x we have Tx is equal to x prime.

36
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:40,344
Now, obviously this is a well defined map and by the properties of the derivative it's also a linear map.

37
00:03:40,544 --> 00:03:46,342
In other words it's an operator and now we can show, it's an unbounded one

38
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:51,035
and this is not hard at all, because we can just look at some pictures.

39
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:57,566
So maybe imagine that we have some nice smooth functions here, where the maximum is at 1.

40
00:03:57,766 --> 00:04:02,705
Now, this fact helps for calculating the supremum norm of T.

41
00:04:03,014 --> 00:04:07,729
So I think it's very helpful to write down the definition of the supremum norm again.

42
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:15,157
So one possibility is to take the supremum over all possible inputs that have norm 1

43
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:21,005
and please note all these possible x elements have to come from the chosen domain here

44
00:04:21,205 --> 00:04:25,869
and then we can just take the supremum of the norm Tx.

45
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:33,385
Ok so this is the general definition of the supremum norm if we just filled in the chosen norm of the two spaces

46
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:38,294
and then in the next step here we can use the definition of our T.

47
00:04:38,494 --> 00:04:46,358
So you see what goes in here is now the maximal value of the absolute value of the derivative of the function x.

48
00:04:46,857 --> 00:04:54,823
Hence by going back to our picture here, we see that we can define a new function with a higher maximal derivative there.

49
00:04:55,143 --> 00:05:00,114
So you should see the slope here is simply higher than that from the function before

50
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:06,611
and then you should see we can do that again and again to increase the slope as much as we want

51
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:13,247
and the important part by doing that is that we don't increase the supremum norm of the function x.

52
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:20,180
Ok and then we have to conclude that the supremum of the derivative here is not bounded.

53
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,064
In other words the operator norm of T is equal to infinity.

54
00:05:25,264 --> 00:05:29,093
So indeed we have an unbounded operator here

55
00:05:29,293 --> 00:05:33,583
and you should note this was not a complicated operator at all.

56
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:40,409
Ok then I would say let's use this example to define another unbounded operator

57
00:05:40,609 --> 00:05:45,964
and let's use this same space as X and Y and let's call the operator S.

58
00:05:46,164 --> 00:05:53,578
Indeed we can also use the same definition as before with the derivative, but now I want to change the domain.

59
00:05:53,778 --> 00:06:00,327
Now, I only want to use some particular continuously differentiable functions for the domain.

60
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:08,019
So we could write: let's choose functions x in C^1 that are fixed on the left boundary.

61
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:12,675
Namely x(0) = 0.

62
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:20,250
This means now we have a new subspace of continuous functions which is definitely smaller than the one before.

63
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:26,478
Otherwise you see everything is the same as we had it for the operator T.

64
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:31,100
Therefore there are some special notations one uses usually for this fact

65
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:36,227
and this is a little bit strange, because we use an inclusion symbol for operators,

66
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:41,746
but it makes literally sense if you put in the corresponding domains.

67
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:51,669
Hence the subset notation here actually means that S in T are essentially the same operator, but S has a smaller domain

68
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:57,029
and for this reason one says that T is an extension of S.

69
00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:01,375
So this is definitely something you should remember in this context

70
00:07:01,643 --> 00:07:07,135
and on the other hand the operator S is called a restriction for the operator T.

71
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:13,507
So you see the names make sense and they are always used if we talk about domains.

72
00:07:13,707 --> 00:07:20,067
Indeed, we will see that changing the domain, making it smaller or larger, can change a lot.

73
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:25,154
For example in this case here the inverse operator changes.

74
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:30,744
In fact the operator T does not have an inverse, because it's not injective.

75
00:07:30,944 --> 00:07:35,675
Simply because any constant function has derivative 0.

76
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:42,347
However this doesn't happen to S, because the only constant function is the 0 function.

77
00:07:42,886 --> 00:07:46,559
Hence we conclude that S is an injective operator

78
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:52,101
and as explained before we can write down S^-1.

79
00:07:52,301 --> 00:07:56,865
So this is a well defined operator in the sense of our definition.

80
00:07:57,065 --> 00:08:01,973
Ok, but I can tell you this nice fact here comes with a price.

81
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:07,936
Namely the domain of the restriction S is much smaller than the original domain.

82
00:08:08,136 --> 00:08:14,602
More precisely the continuously differentiable functions lie dense in the continuous functions

83
00:08:14,957 --> 00:08:22,899
or more precisely the closer of C^1 with respect to the supremum norm is equal to C.

84
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:27,591
Indeed this is a very nice fact from the continuously differentiable functions.

85
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:33,423
However with the restriction here on the left-hand side this doesn't hold anymore.

86
00:08:33,623 --> 00:08:39,537
We immediately see that we can't approximate any constant function that is not the 0 function

87
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:44,306
and therefore the operator S is not densely defined

88
00:08:44,506 --> 00:08:50,525
and you might already expect that in most cases we want to have a densely defined operator,

89
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:55,458
because otherwise we are just too far away from the original space.

90
00:08:55,658 --> 00:09:00,500
Of course in general it would be the best thing to have the whole space as a domain,

91
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:04,829
but we have already seen this is not possible for a lot of operators

92
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:12,663
and in fact for most unbounded operators we are interested in it's not possible to define them on the whole space.

93
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:16,896
So we always have to weaken that to densely defined operators,

94
00:09:17,614 --> 00:09:21,658
but I would say let's see how this works out with the next videos.

95
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:26,100
So I really hope that I see you there and have a nice day. Bye-bye
