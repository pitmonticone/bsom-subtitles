00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,243
Hello and welcome back to unbounded operators.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,670
The video series in the field of functional analysis

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:12,646
and in today's part 3 we will define so called closed operators.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:20,971
Indeed it will turn out that these closed operators are related to the continuity property that bounded operators have.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,332
So in some sense this is the generalization we want now.

6
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:28,029
However, you already know before we start

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,916
I first want to thank all the nice people who support this channel on Steady, here on YouTube or via Patreon

8
00:00:34,116 --> 00:00:41,419
and please don't forget, you can also download quizzes and PDF versions for all the videos with the link in the description.

9
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:46,370
Ok, then let's start again by telling what we mean by an operator.

10
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:54,217
So an operator T is just a linear map between two normed spaces X and Y, but we can have a domain

11
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:58,830
and usually what we do is that we call this domain D(T).

12
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,775
So in general T is not defined on the whole normed space X,

13
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:08,392
but still, it has to be a linear mapping between the two spaces.

14
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:15,474
Ok and now since this is a well defined map, we can identify it with its graph

15
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:21,787
and this you might know. It's just a special subset in the Cartesian product X times Y.

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,872
This means we can simply sketch it into a coordinate system.

17
00:01:27,457 --> 00:01:31,510
Hence in general you would sketch a graph like that.

18
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:39,365
However since we have a linear mapping here, we should also make it clear that we have a linear relation as a graph.

19
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:42,460
Moreover since we work in infinite dimensions,

20
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:48,225
in reality we would expect that the picture looks much more complicated than this line,

21
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:55,457
but still the general idea here of this set given by this graph of T still holds.

22
00:01:55,657 --> 00:02:01,101
Ok, then let's give this set a short name. Let's call it G index T

23
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:05,842
and now we can define it as a subset of X times Y.

24
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:12,366
This means we just have to write down what one point (x,y) has to fulfill.

25
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:20,956
First that x lies in the domain of T and second we need that Tx is equal to y.

26
00:02:21,156 --> 00:02:25,177
So the image of our x is exactly the point y.

27
00:02:25,614 --> 00:02:31,464
So not so surprising this is how in general we would define the graph of a map.

28
00:02:31,664 --> 00:02:38,429
However here we have a little bit more, because this Cartesian product here is a normed space again.

29
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:44,813
Hence it's not just a set. It's a whole vector space, where we can also measure lengths

30
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:49,750
and at this point you should ask what is the corresponding norm here.

31
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,515
In other words what is the correct length of the pair (x,y)?

32
00:02:54,715 --> 00:03:01,591
Indeed there are different possibilities to do that, but the common one is just to add two norms we already know.

33
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:06,309
So first take the norm of x and then add the norm of y

34
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:11,429
and now it's not hard to check at all, that this here defines a norm again.

35
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:19,768
Hence we always have a normed space with the Cartesian product, with X and Y are normed spaces from the beginning

36
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:26,337
and therefore you can say now in the graph of T we can also measure distances

37
00:03:26,537 --> 00:03:31,974
or more precisely we can use all the topological terms we have for the graph of T.

38
00:03:32,174 --> 00:03:38,178
In particular we can also check if the graph of T is a closed set

39
00:03:38,378 --> 00:03:44,593
and that's exactly what we do now in order to define so called closed operators.

40
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:54,358
So you see we call T a closed operator if its graph is a closed set in the normed space X times Y.

41
00:03:54,558 --> 00:04:01,984
So not a complicated definition at all, we just have to know what closed sets in normed spaces are

42
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:06,924
and the good thing is, we can assume that we already know a lot.

43
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:13,882
In particular we know that we can also work with sequences to define closed sets

44
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:19,400
and this means we immediately get an equivalent definition for a closed operator.

45
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:26,066
More precisely instead of working with a closed set, we can also work with sequences.

46
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:32,946
So, what we have to do is to take arbitrary sequence x_n inside the domain

47
00:04:33,146 --> 00:04:36,271
and this one has to fulfill 2 properties.

48
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:41,714
So first it should be a convergent sequence in the normed space X.

49
00:04:42,414 --> 00:04:47,013
This means it has a limit that lies in the space X.

50
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:51,357
So we don't have to assume that the limit lies in the domain

51
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:57,559
and second we assume that the sequence of the images is also convergent.

52
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,185
So Tx_n converges inside the space Y to a limit y

53
00:05:03,543 --> 00:05:10,486
and now the claim is that for each sequence with these two properties we can conclude 2 other properties.

54
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:16,241
The first one is indeed this limit x lies in the domain of T

55
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:22,758
and this immediately implies that we are allowed to apply T to this x as well

56
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:28,640
and then we get the second property. This image is indeed equal to y.

57
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:37,427
So this sounds not so strange, but maybe at this point you can immediately compare this definition to the continuity definition.

58
00:05:37,886 --> 00:05:44,747
Indeed, this is what I mentioned before. We want to use this definition as a substitute for the continuity.

59
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:50,542
This is because we already know, unbounded operators are not continuous.

60
00:05:50,886 --> 00:05:56,030
Ok, now I thing we can also write down the proof for this statement from before.

61
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:59,621
So we want to improve the equivalence stated here

62
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:06,824
and in fact I already gave you the hint. Closed sets can be equivalently described by sequences.

63
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,634
So you should know, this works in general, in metric spaces. So in particular here in normed spaces.

64
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:22,336
So what you have to do is to take a sequence from the set and you have to assume that this one is convergent.

65
00:06:22,536 --> 00:06:29,191
So please don't forget this means the sequence is convergent in our normed space X times Y.

66
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:36,671
So maybe here let's call the limit also z and the important thing is, it lies in X times Y,

67
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:43,609
because now the important conclusion here is that this z also lies in G_T.

68
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:51,760
So you should see, this is the general thing. Closed means you can not leave this set with sequence from inside

69
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:58,796
and this is indeed equivalent. All the boundary points already lie inside the set itself.

70
00:06:58,996 --> 00:07:04,852
Ok, so this should not be a surprise and now we want to put this into the context of an operator.

71
00:07:05,052 --> 00:07:10,666
So first instead of z_n we can already write what we know about the graph.

72
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:15,887
Namely that it always consists of a pair. (x_n, Tx_n).

73
00:07:16,243 --> 00:07:21,238
So a sequence inside the graph of T always has this form.

74
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:26,483
Ok and now this sequence should converge to a point in our Cartesian product

75
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:30,710
and this limit we can just call (x,y).

76
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:38,591
Ok, but now this claim here tells us that this pair (x,y) also lies in the graph of T

77
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:43,606
and by the definition of the graph, this exactly means 2 things.

78
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:47,087
First our point x lies in the domain

79
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:51,355
and second Tx is exactly y

80
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,281
and there you should already see, this is exactly the conclusion in the claim above

81
00:07:56,481 --> 00:08:01,153
and now the only difference here is the assumption from before.

82
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:06,070
However, now we can conclude by the definition of the norm in the Cartesian product

83
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:11,324
that this convergence here is nothing else then this convergence.

84
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:18,477
Indeed, you could say here, if you want to converge to the pair, you have to converge in each component

85
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:23,818
and converging with the two components is exactly what we have written here

86
00:08:24,018 --> 00:08:28,584
and with that I would say the proof is good enough. We have this equivalence here

87
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:36,281
and I would say this sequence definition here is what you should always have in mind when you talk about closed operators

88
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:41,359
and then it's also no problem at all for you to show the following.

89
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,902
Namely let's consider a bounded operator.

90
00:08:45,186 --> 00:08:49,926
In addition the domain of T should also be the whole space X.

91
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:55,352
So this is an operator like we had it in our functional analysis course before

92
00:08:55,714 --> 00:09:02,138
and in fact the conclusion here is that such a standard bounded operator is a closed one.

93
00:09:02,338 --> 00:09:06,611
So you should see, this closed operator notion is so important,

94
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:13,395
because it's our generalization from the bounded operators to the unbounded operators, as we wanted.

95
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:20,156
More precisely closed operators still have some nice properties the bounded operators had.

96
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:24,811
However the details for that is something for the next videos.

97
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:27,613
In particular we will look at examples,

98
00:09:27,813 --> 00:09:30,268
we will talk about closable operators

99
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:34,413
and we will have a look at the so called closed graph theorem.

100
00:09:34,613 --> 00:09:39,271
So I really hope we meet again and have a nice day. Bye-bye!
