00:00:00,286 --> 00:00:04,059
Hello and welcome back to unbounded operators.

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:07,716
The video series in the topic of functional analysis

3
00:00:07,916 --> 00:00:12,987
and in today's part 4 we will talk about so called closable operators.

4
00:00:13,187 --> 00:00:15,758
However, before we start with the content

5
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:21,980
I first want to thank all the nice people who support this channel on Steady, here on YouTube or on Patreon

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:28,969
and as a reward for supporting me, you get additional material which you can find with the link in the description.

7
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:35,130
Ok, then let's start going into the topic by recalling what a closed operator is.

8
00:00:35,686 --> 00:00:40,392
The common name is just T and we need two normed spaces X and Y

9
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:45,832
and now it's important to note that we also have a domain for the operator called D(T).

10
00:00:46,032 --> 00:00:50,986
Indeed, this is a well defined linear subspace in the normed space X

11
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:56,389
and please don't forget, for us an operator is always a linear map

12
00:00:56,589 --> 00:01:03,261
and now we speak of a closed operator if the graph of this linear map is a closed set.

13
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:11,513
More precisely we call the graph G_T and it should be a closed set inside the normed space X times Y.

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:19,100
Ok and now if you know some topology or if you know how to deal with closed sets in the metric space,

15
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,542
then you know each set is a subset of a closed set.

16
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:31,064
In other words if this set is not closed, we can always replace that with the closure of the set

17
00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:35,992
and this fact leads us to so called closable operators.

18
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:43,708
So this is a more general term. Meaning that each closed operator is always also a closable operator.

19
00:01:44,357 --> 00:01:50,703
However it's still a requirement. Not every operator is indeed a closable operator

20
00:01:51,143 --> 00:01:55,049
and of course we immediately see that in the definition.

21
00:01:55,249 --> 00:02:01,568
So what we do is that we take the graph G_T as before and then we form the closure of it

22
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:06,498
and please note in the case of a closed operator this doesn't change anything

23
00:02:06,698 --> 00:02:14,006
and now what we want for a closable operator is that this new set here is also the graph of an operator.

24
00:02:14,206 --> 00:02:21,507
This means by doing the closure in the space X times Y, we don't destroy the structure of a graph

25
00:02:22,029 --> 00:02:28,270
and now in the case that this is a well defined graph, we call the operator T with an overline

26
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:34,047
and moreover we also call this operator the closure of the operator T

27
00:02:34,247 --> 00:02:39,411
and of course by definition the closure of T is a closed operator.

28
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:48,271
Hence you can remember an operator is called closable, if the closure of the graph defines an operator as well.

29
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:53,755
So indeed, this is what we have here as the definition for the notion closable

30
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:59,370
and in the next step I want to reformulate that with the help of sequences.

31
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:06,156
In fact this is a similar thing we have already done for closed operators in the last video

32
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:12,871
and I can already tell you, this is a very helpful description you can use in proofs and examples.

33
00:03:13,357 --> 00:03:18,602
You will see that very soon when we will discuss the first example of a closable operator,

34
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:25,555
but first let's see how we can use sequences to describe this property for describing the graph of T.

35
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,572
Therefore let's think what it means that the closure of T is a graph again.

36
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:41,388
So for example it's not possible that the pair (0,0) and the pair (0,y), both lie in this set

37
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:47,571
and of course what we mean is, it's not possible for a y that is not 0.

38
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:55,841
Indeed, you should see this is not possible for a well defined map, because one input gets two different outputs.

39
00:03:56,471 --> 00:04:04,819
Moreover this description here already explains everything that could happen with the closure here, because T is a linear map.

40
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:14,171
Hence we already know that (0,0) lies in this set here and we could also choose any other point then 0 for the input,

41
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:20,829
because of the linearity or in other words, if we have this double problem here at any other point,

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,345
we can just translate it back to the input 0.

43
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:30,274
Therefore now we can write that being a graph here is equivalent to the fact:

44
00:04:30,786 --> 00:04:37,353
if (0,y) lies in the closure of this graph, then y has to be 0 as well

45
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,351
and exactly this statement we can now describe with sequences.

46
00:04:42,686 --> 00:04:49,862
So what you need to know is, that all the points in the closure we can approximate with points from G_T.

47
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,190
Therefore we would take any sequence x_n from the domain D(T) that converges to 0

48
00:04:57,914 --> 00:05:06,252
Which already means that we want to approximate this 0 here and moreover we also want to approximate this y.

49
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:11,509
Hence Tx_n should converge to a fixed y in Y.

50
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:19,975
Ok, so this is the premise. We approximate this point from the inside and now the conclusion is that y has to be 0.

51
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:25,157
So this is exactly the same thing as before just written with sequences.

52
00:05:25,614 --> 00:05:33,543
Ok and this is what you should remember. A closable operator is exactly characterized with this sequence property here.

53
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:38,649
Indeed, how you can check that, I will show you in an example soon.

54
00:05:38,986 --> 00:05:45,214
However before we do that I first want to show you how we can define the closure as an operator now

55
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,426
and of course this now only works for a closable operator T

56
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:57,616
and for this definition we need 2 ingredients. First the domain and then the actual definition of T-bar.

57
00:05:58,457 --> 00:06:03,490
Ok and now the domain consists all the points x in X that fulfill:

58
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,219
that first we can approximate them with points from D(T).

59
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:17,720
This means the sequence x_n here converges to the point x and in addition we also want that the images converge

60
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:25,242
and now we know by the property above that this limit here does not depend on which sequence we choose.

61
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,003
More precisely this limit here is uniquely given by the chosen x.

62
00:06:31,486 --> 00:06:37,680
Hence this already explains how we can define the value T-bar_x.

63
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:42,330
So we just say, this is given by the limit from the right-hand side

64
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,090
and please don't forget, this is only possible because T was a closable operator.

65
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:54,748
Ok, so now what you see here is, we have a well defined operator called the closure of T

66
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:59,887
and moreover, you should see it's an extension of the original operator T

67
00:07:00,429 --> 00:07:05,548
and you already know, the usual notation for that is with this subset notation.

68
00:07:06,157 --> 00:07:12,032
This is not hard to see, because we just extend the domain here and increase the definition.

69
00:07:12,457 --> 00:07:20,995
However the result here is that this T-bar is indeed the smallest possible extension with a closed operator.

70
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:27,478
So you could say this is another possible definition for the closure of a closable operator.

71
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:33,671
Ok, so now we know a lot about closable operators and we can look at an example.

72
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,775
However, I would say let's put that into the next video.

73
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:41,848
So I really hope we meet there again and have a nice day. Bye-bye
