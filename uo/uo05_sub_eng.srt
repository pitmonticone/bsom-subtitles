00:00:00,449 --> 00:00:02,109
 Hello and welcome back

2
00:00:02,119 --> 00:00:04,000
 to unbounded operators,

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,260
 the video series where we

4
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:06,880
 talk a lot about some nice

5
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:09,179
 topics of functional analysis.

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,630
 And indeed, in today's part 5 we will continue with

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,539
 the closable operators by

8
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,068
 looking at an example.

9
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:17,879
 But you might already know

10
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:19,190
 before we can do that,

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,639
 I first want to thank all

12
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:21,889
 the nice people who support

13
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:23,059
 the channel on Steady here

14
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:24,870
 on YouTube or on Patreon.

15
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,950
 And please don't forget on

16
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:27,950
 these platforms

17
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:29,309
 you find PDF versions,

18
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:32,939
 quizzes and early access to all new videos.

19
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,000
 OK.

20
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:35,310
 Then let's start this video

21
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:36,970
 here by considering a

22
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:38,950
 closable operator T

23
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,779
 and there you already know

24
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,290
 for the definition, we need

25
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:44,790
 two normed spaces X and Y.

26
00:00:45,169 --> 00:00:46,220
 And at this point, I can

27
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:47,849
 already tell you in order

28
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,580
 to get nice theorems

29
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,380
 out, we have to assume that

30
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:52,729
 X and Y are Banach

31
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,549
 spaces.

32
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:54,909
 So complete normed

33
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:55,740
 spaces.

34
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,439
 In fact, also in this example

35
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,209
 today, we will take Banach

36
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,959
 spaces.

37
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,180
 But let's first write down

38
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:04,459
 the general sequence

39
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,080
 characterization for a

40
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:07,419
 closable operator.

41
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,680
 There, we just have to look

42
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,129
 at sequences that

43
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:12,769
 converge to the origin

44
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,819
 and they have to have the

45
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,139
 property that the

46
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,449
 images also

47
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:19,180
 converge and

48
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,059
 then the conclusion is that

49
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:22,860
 only the zero vector in

50
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,739
 Y is possible for this

51
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,260
 limit.

52
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,279
 Therefore, please remember

53
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,699
 here, if we have this

54
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:30,580
 implication, we know that

55
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:32,430
 the operator T is closable.

56
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,540
 And this is exactly what

57
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,099
 we now apply to the

58
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,650
 following example.

59
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,319
 And in order to make it very

60
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,089
 concrete, let's choose a

61
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:42,919
 very nice Banach space for

62
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,900
 X. Namely

63
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,739
 X should be given as lower

64
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,940
 case l^2.

65
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,099
 So you know this is a space

66
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,629
 of sequences with

67
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:53,400
 index set N and

68
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,809
 entries in C.

69
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,989
 And please recall from the

70
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,699
 functional analysis series

71
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,230
 that this is a well defined

72
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,150
 Banach space.

73
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,569
 Moreover, it's even a Hilbert

74
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,940
 space, but this is not so

75
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:06,129
 important right now.

76
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:07,349
 OK.

77
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,089
 In addition, let's also fix

78
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,660
 the canonical unit vectors

79
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,559
 denoted by e_1, e_2, e_3 and so on.

80
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,889
 Now, if you don't know them,

81
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:17,369
 then maybe very quickly,

82
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,550
 e_2 is given as the

83
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:19,479
 sequence

84
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,660
 0100

85
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:23,410
 and so on.

86
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,309
 In other words, everything

87
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,929
 is 0 in the sequence

88
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,649
 except the second position,

89
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,610
 which is a 1.

90
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:31,770
 So you see this is exactly

91
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:33,009
 the same as you would have

92
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,110
 it in a finite dimensional

93
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:35,860
 vector space, but now in

94
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:37,279
 infinite dimensions.

95
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,429
 OK.

96
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,699
 And now I want the operator

97
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,490
 T going from X to

98
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,940
 C and

99
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:44,919
 obviously C is also a normed

100
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:46,339
 space, even a Banach

101
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,039
 space.

102
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:49,259
 Then in the next step, I

103
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,589
 want to define the domain

104
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,410
 of T and this

105
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:54,179
 should be given as the span

106
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,520
 of the canonical unit

107
00:02:55,529 --> 00:02:56,220
 vectors.

108
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:58,630
 This means all the linear

109
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,220
 combinations of the canonical

110
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:01,919
 unit vectors lie in the

111
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:02,960
 domain of T.

112
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,979
 And here please note this

113
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,660
 is not equal to the whole

114
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:08,300
 space X, but it's a

115
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:09,720
 dense subset in it.

116
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,000
 OK.

117
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:12,500
 And now this domain makes

118
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:14,139
 it very easy to write

119
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:15,949
 down a nice definition for

120
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
 an operator T.

121
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,550
 Namely we just have to say

122
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:21,539
 what D does to a canonical

123
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,320
 unit vector.

124
00:03:23,089 --> 00:03:24,350
 And for example, we could

125
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,639
 just say take the

126
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:27,509
 corresponding index of the

127
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,320
 unit vector.

128
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:30,759
 Therefore T would

129
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,300
 send e_2 to the number 2

130
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,940
 and now, since we want a

131
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,729
 linear map, the extension

132
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,440
 to the whole span here is

133
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:39,570
 uniquely given.

134
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,649
 But for the sake of completeness,

135
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,000
 let's write it down.

136
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:45,589
 So let's say we have a finite

137
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,719
 linear combination lambda_j times e_j.

138
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,490
 So please note this here

139
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,070
 is always a finite sum,

140
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,110
 because this is what the

141
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,089
 span means.

142
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,080
 It means the set of the finite

143
00:03:56,089 --> 00:03:57,990
 linear combinations of these

144
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,710
 vectors.

145
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,279
 And therefore the mapping

146
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:01,559
 here is totally clear, we

147
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,500
 just add up lambda_j times j

148
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:06,880
 This gives us a complex number

149
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:08,979
 which is the output of T.

150
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:10,029
 OK.

151
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,160
 And the first question from

152
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:12,960
 my side would be is

153
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,529
 this an unbounded or a

154
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:15,660
 bounded operator?

155
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,750
 To answer that we can just

156
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,559
 calculate the operator norm

157
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,343
 of T.

158
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,609
 By definition, this is the

159
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:24,410
 supremum over all

160
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,760
 inputs X with norm 1.

162
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:29,220
 And then we look at the norm

163
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,480
 of the images.

164
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,779
 Which in this case is the

165
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,890
 norm of C.

166
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,040
 But of course, the norm in

167
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:37,820
 C is just the absolute

168
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:39,709
 value of complex numbers.

169
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,649
 And now let's say instead

170
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,459
 of every vector x, we just

171
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,089
 put in the canonical unit

172
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,980
 vectors. Then the

173
00:04:46,989 --> 00:04:48,880
 whole supremum cannot get

174
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,440
 bigger.

175
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,450
 Then everything is much simpler.

176
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,850
 We just have to calculate

177
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,279
 the absolute value of

178
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,200
 Te_j.

179
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,869
 But by the definition of

180
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,600
 the operator T, we already

181
00:04:58,609 --> 00:05:00,770
 know this is just the number j.

182
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,859
 And at this point, we already

183
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,470
 see the supremum over

184
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,269
 j is not finite.

185
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,480
 Therefore, the operator norm

186
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:10,279
 of T can also not be

187
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:10,959
 finite.

188
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,869
 So the first conclusion here

189
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,660
 is we have an unbounded

190
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,359
 operator.

191
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:17,579
 Therefore my next question

192
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:19,149
 would be, is it at least a

193
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,660
 closable operator?

194
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:22,500
 And in order to answer this

195
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,380
 question, we will use our

196
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,160
 sequence property for closable

197
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,820
 operators from before.

198
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,859
 And we can combine that with

199
00:05:29,869 --> 00:05:31,179
 the fact that we have an

200
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,660
 operator which is not

201
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,980
 continuous at the

202
00:05:33,989 --> 00:05:34,690
 origin.

203
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:36,640
 So please never forget for

204
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:38,450
 linear maps, boundedness

205
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:39,959
 and continuity are

206
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,720
 connected.

207
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:41,920
 OK.

208
00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:43,250
 Then let's use this fact

209
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,799
 here for a sequence that

210
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:46,079
 converges to zero.

211
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:48,309
 So what we can do is to choose

212
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,040
 a sequence inside the

213
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,019
 domain of T that converges

214
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:53,019
 to the origin.

215
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:54,989
 And now we know that we have

216
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,679
 at least one sequence with

217
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,040
 the property, that the

218
00:05:58,049 --> 00:05:59,839
 images don't converge to

219
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,359
 zero.

220
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:02,980
 The operator T is not continuous

221
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:03,690
 at zero.

222
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,070
 So this is possible

223
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,350
 however, still it could

224
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,170
 happen that the images here

225
00:06:09,179 --> 00:06:11,070
 accumulate at zero.

226
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,190
 But we also know that for

227
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,790
 infinitely many sequence

228
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:16,500
 members that does not happen.

229
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,459
 So it's possible to choose

230
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,369
 a safety distant epsilon

231
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,269
 from zero

232
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,739
 and a subsequence

233
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,100
 x_nk

234
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,239
 such that the images

235
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,019
 stay away from zero

236
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:30,769
 with distance epsilon.

237
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,709
 So the absolute value is

238
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,660
 greater or equal than our

239
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,260
 epsilon.

240
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:37,220
 Therefore, now we can

241
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,029
 conclude it's allowed to

242
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,720
 divide by this number.

243
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:42,829
 Hence, we can define a new

244
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,679
 sequence and let's call it

245
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,640
 z_k.

246
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,000
 So we take x_nk and then

247
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,950
 we divide this by the number

248
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,869
 Tx_nk.

249
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,000
 So this one is definitely

250
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,850
 a well-defined element in

251
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:55,959
 the domain of T.

252
00:06:56,609 --> 00:06:58,549
 And moreover, if we increase

253
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,269
 k, we also see that

254
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,250
 this sequence tends to zero.

255
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,450
 So in this regard, it works

256
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,070
 the same as our original

257
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,309
 sequence x_n.

258
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,049
 However, for the images,

259
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:11,850
 something different happens,

260
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,970
 namely, we immediately

261
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,269
 see that we divide 1 by 1.

262
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,769
 So the outcome is always

263
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,750
 1. No matter which

264
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,549
 k from N we choose.

265
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,730
 And with that, we now have

266
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:25,579
 our counter example for the

267
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:27,570
 characterization for a closable

268
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:28,940
 operator with

269
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,720
 sequences.

270
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,649
 In fact, we can immediately

271
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,619
 compare it here.

272
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,519
 Now we have a sequence in

273
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:36,130
 the domain of T which

274
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,579
 converges to zero

275
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,470
 and the images also

276
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,859
 converge to a y,

277
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:43,220
 in particular, the y in

278
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,620
 our case is given by 1

279
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:47,660
 and that's already the contradiction

280
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,630
 because y has to be equal

281
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,510
 to zero if the operator

282
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,399
 T is closable.

283
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:54,700
 And with that, we can make

284
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,700
 our conclusion T is not

285
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,040
 a closable operator.

286
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,649
 And this also includes that

287
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,269
 T is not a closed operator

288
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:02,910
 as well.

289
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:04,989
 Therefore, this is important

290
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,510
 to remember in infinite

291
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,290
 dimensions, we can easily

292
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:09,579
 define unbounded

293
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,290
 operators that are not even

294
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:11,690
 closable.

295
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:13,910
 But I can already tell you

296
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,410
 in this course, we will also

297
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,989
 see a lot of closed

298
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,709
 operators.

299
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,549
 So a lot of positive examples.

300
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:20,790
 OK.

301
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:21,790
 Then I really hope we meet

302
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:23,190
 again and have a nice day.

303
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,910
 Bye bye.
