Hello and welcome back to the bright side of mathematics.

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:10,035
In this video here I want to show you the learning path I envisioned for my videos

3
00:00:10,235 --> 00:00:13,379
and which you can also use to learn mathematics.

4
00:00:13,657 --> 00:00:19,657
For this you can use my webpage here. Which is thebrightsideofmathematics.com

5
00:00:19,857 --> 00:00:26,756
and usually it's for my Steady supporters, Patreon supporters and the members on YouTube to find additional material.

6
00:00:26,814 --> 00:00:30,898
However, the things I want to show you now are completely for free :)

7
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:40,215
So what you should do here is, you either click overview network or on this button "get started", to see the network of my videos.

8
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:47,058
So the idea here is that each node represents a playlist on YouTube, a whole series

9
00:00:47,258 --> 00:00:53,348
and each arrow here, each edge shows you in which order you should go through these videos,

10
00:00:53,714 --> 00:01:00,987
but maybe for the first step, just ignore the arrows altogether and just read the picture from top to bottom.

11
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:06,780
Which means you first have to understand the things on the top to understand the things downstairs

12
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:09,971
and there we immediately see the foundation,

13
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:17,401
the language we need to learn first to understand mathematics is given here in my start learning mathematics series

14
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:24,468
and moreover if things are on the same level, it's best to go through them left to right.

15
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:29,371
This means here you first should understand how basic logic works in mathematics

16
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:36,043
and then you can go through the sets and in the end you understand how we construct the number sets.

17
00:01:36,543 --> 00:01:42,757
By the way, you can just click on a node to find the corresponding videos on YouTube.

18
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:50,019
Here for example we have the start learning sets series and this button here brings you to YouTube

19
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:52,685
and to the first video in the series

20
00:01:53,243 --> 00:02:00,621
and here I can already tell you learning how sets work is very important for the rest of the courses altogether.

21
00:02:01,186 --> 00:02:05,863
Ok, then next in the list after my whole start mathematics series,

22
00:02:06,063 --> 00:02:11,299
we find almost on the same level, linear algebra and real analysis

23
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:15,636
and there you might already know, these are very important courses,

24
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:19,825
because in linear algebra you learn how to deal with vectors

25
00:02:19,843 --> 00:02:23,715
and in real analysis you learn how to calculate with functions

26
00:02:23,915 --> 00:02:29,164
and this knowledge is indeed needed to understand all the topics below.

27
00:02:29,364 --> 00:02:35,429
So for example, functional analysis needs the knowledge from linear algebra and real analysis.

28
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:44,320
But in the best case you also have knowledge about all these topics that are before on top of functional analysis on this level here

29
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,229
and if I say knowledge it doesn't mean that you have to watch every video in the series above,

30
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:54,783
it just means, if there is a question that occurs while watching functional analysis,

31
00:02:54,983 --> 00:03:00,494
maybe you have to go back to some specific video in the series above.

32
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,416
So for example if you start with the complex analysis series here,

33
00:03:05,616 --> 00:03:09,150
you might follow that easily with your knowledge of complex numbers,

34
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,470
but at some point you might think:

35
00:03:11,514 --> 00:03:19,040
"I should refresh my knowledge about multivariable calculus to understand the partial derivatives that occur there."

36
00:03:19,471 --> 00:03:27,128
Ok, so there we have it. This is the map for my videos and you can use it for free, for your own learning path

37
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,308
and if you want to support me, you can do that on Steady, Patreon or here on YouTube.

38
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:37,143
Thank you very much and see you next time. Bye-bye!
