00:00:00,586 --> 00:00:06,743
Hello and welcome back to a new video on the channel that is called "The Bright Side of Mathematics".

2
00:00:06,943 --> 00:00:10,968
A channel that has now reached 100k subscribers

3
00:00:11,014 --> 00:00:14,505
and in order to celebrate that. I want to make some videos like that,

4
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:20,336
that are not part of a huge video course, but explain a little bit how to learn mathematics

5
00:00:20,743 --> 00:00:25,514
and you see I want to start that by telling you how not to learn mathematics.

6
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:29,350
So in other words I want to show you some common mistakes

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:37,806
and I know a lot of mistakes simply because I made them myself and I teach mathematics for a very long time know.

8
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:44,945
Indeed I checked that for this video and it turned out, I do this thing for the last 20 years now.

9
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:54,600
In fact I started in high school. Explaining basic mathematics how I learned it. So basic calculations to other friends, to other pupils

10
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:59,555
and then I continued that in the university with more advanced mathematics

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,224
and then after teaching that for work at universities, you know see I continue that here on YouTube.

12
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:14,424
However especially at the universities I met a lot of students, indeed motivated students,

13
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,429
that still made a lot of mistakes while learning mathematics.

14
00:01:18,657 --> 00:01:24,567
Then let's start with the first mistake here, which I call not having the correct prerequisites.

15
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:30,087
In mathematics this is especially very common and it can feel very frustrating.

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,468
It can happen to everyone and it also happened to me, when I studied.

17
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:40,564
In my first year at the university I was sitting in a functional analysis class.

18
00:01:40,764 --> 00:01:45,100
Simply because I found it interesting and I wanted to learn that stuff.

19
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:47,463
However I felt very stupid.

20
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:55,441
The whole thing was very hard and I could not even ask the correct questions. I was not able to formulate what went wrong.

21
00:01:55,786 --> 00:02:05,650
The reason for that is easy to explain, because I didn't even learn the basic real analysis parts that was needed for this course.

22
00:02:06,286 --> 00:02:11,819
So I was not stupid. I was simply not ready to understand functional analysis yet.

23
00:02:12,429 --> 00:02:19,506
In the end the solution was very simple. Very simple to understand. I simply changed the order of learning stuff.

24
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:26,787
The key element I learned there, you could summarize as "mathematics is linearly to learn". More or less.

25
00:02:26,987 --> 00:02:32,008
So the thing is you need to understand the foundations to move on.

26
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:37,365
You need to learn the basic stuff first and then you can move to more advanced stuff.

27
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:45,604
In other words if it's really frustrating to learn a particular topic, you have to check what are the prerequisites you need

28
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:48,357
and then you go back and learn them first.

29
00:02:48,743 --> 00:02:56,524
I can tell you another example, because once I explained the LU-decomposition for matrices to some students.

30
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,300
The group was very motivated and there was no problem in the learning atmosphere.

31
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:06,084
I could explain all the details step by step for this decomposition.

32
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:12,790
However, during the whole explanation there were a lot of questions and I saw people were puzzled.

33
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:16,549
It took me a long time to understand what went wrong.

34
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:25,191
After some time I realized they weren't struggling at all with this abstract concept or the abstract notions around it

35
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:27,646
or even this algorithm I explained.

36
00:03:28,214 --> 00:03:33,311
The problem simply was that in my calculation I reduced a fraction.

37
00:03:33,843 --> 00:03:41,005
In the calculation there was something like 15/18 and after some steps I simply wrote 5/6.

38
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:46,250
It took me some time to realise that for some people that was simply too much.

39
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:50,964
It was too fast. It was too sudden. It was too hidden in the rest of the calculation.

40
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:55,665
They couldn't see that this fraction was indeed the same as this fraction there.

41
00:03:56,243 --> 00:04:02,053
So there was no problem at all in the linear algebra part. There was simply a problem in the foundation.

42
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:05,695
In the foundation were you learn to calculate with fractions.

43
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:11,717
Indeed, I would say this leads us immediately to the second mistake. The second common mistake.

44
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,112
Which is that there is no practice involved.

45
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:21,634
This is easily explained. If you just read a book about mathematics or about a particular topic in mathematics,

46
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:23,483
you don't really learn it.

47
00:04:23,486 --> 00:04:25,950
You only learn it if you practice it.

48
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:34,829
Indeed, if you study mathematics at the university, you will notice that there is a big empathize on exercises, on problem solving

49
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:39,940
and of course this is done, because that works. This is how the brain works.

50
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,743
You have to train the brain such that you can learn something

51
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:50,293
and we see, this immediately connects to our third mistake here. That there is no repetition at all.

52
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:56,412
It's a similar idea. You need some repetition such that you get used to new stuff.

53
00:04:56,612 --> 00:05:02,268
For example you need to reduce a lot of fractions such that the whole idea goes into your body.

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,475
So you see, we have 2 important things here. First you need exercises. You need problem solving to understand something

55
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:15,205
and then you need a lot of similar problems to solve such that you get used to that

56
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:23,530
and I can understand this might be very hard for the learning process, because of our next mistake that happens a lot.

57
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:30,234
This is what happens when you try to learn completely alone and then you don't talk about what you learn.

58
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:36,625
Indeed, there are some layers for this problem, for this mistake, because essentially you learn alone.

59
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:44,654
You have to solve the problems alone. You have to understand alone. So learning mathematics is a lot of time spending alone, thinking.

60
00:05:44,854 --> 00:05:48,179
However, it's clearly a mistake just doing that.

61
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:52,229
Just learning for yourself and not talking about what you learn at all.

62
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,341
The first thing that comes to my mind, what you miss by not talking about what you learn in mathematics,

63
00:05:58,429 --> 00:06:02,653
is that you don't see that other people struggle the same as you.

64
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:11,278
Of course also other people struggle to understand the concept, grasping everything that is needed, solving the problems and so on.

65
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,812
So usually you are not alone if you are not understanding things

66
00:06:16,386 --> 00:06:24,029
and then talking about that, of course helps to find some missing links or some missing foundations you need to understand the topic.

67
00:06:24,714 --> 00:06:29,157
Indeed, there I would say this is a common problem with lectures in the university.

68
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:37,036
Were there is just one teacher that explains everything and then you see only the people that really understood it, ask some questions

69
00:06:37,757 --> 00:06:41,889
and then most people in the audience feel intimidated or even stupid

70
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:47,878
and don't see that all the other ones or most of the other ones also have some problems there

71
00:06:48,386 --> 00:06:54,151
and that is a problem for the teacher as well, because some basic questions are not asked at all.

72
00:06:54,843 --> 00:06:58,507
So in summary I can tell you here, by talking to other people,

73
00:06:58,508 --> 00:07:03,669
by trying to explain a particular topic to other people, you understand more.

74
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:12,517
Ok, then the last mistake I want to talk about today is that while you learn mathematics, you only learn isolated results

75
00:07:12,717 --> 00:07:18,557
and that's a mistake, because different results, different concepts are always connected.

76
00:07:18,614 --> 00:07:21,747
Always related to some other parts of mathematics.

77
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:28,279
Actually I would say ignoring such connections here is already a big mistake for your motivation,

78
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:36,747
because how do you motivate yourself learning some isolated result if you don't see how they are embedded in the whole structure,

79
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:41,983
However, of course I know for a beginner it's hard to see such connections,

80
00:07:41,984 --> 00:07:45,774
because everything feels isolated and not motivated at all

81
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:51,060
and that's the reason I put it here as a mistake. It's also something the teacher can solve.

82
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:57,174
So the teacher can make better for you by telling you, what are the prerequisites of a particular concept

83
00:07:57,814 --> 00:08:02,714
and then of course the other part is then telling you in which direction it leads to.

84
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:05,650
So what can we do with our new results.

85
00:08:06,243 --> 00:08:13,357
Indeed, if you want to learn with such a network, you can do it with my real analysis course with the link in the description

86
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:19,481
and I can tell you, it's completely free. You can use it. You can watch my videos and you see the connections you need.

87
00:08:20,157 --> 00:08:27,859
Moreover there you also find exercises such that you don't do the mistakes for learning mathematics I told you today.

88
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:34,135
So I really hope that video helped you and then let's meet in the next one. Have a nice day and bye.
