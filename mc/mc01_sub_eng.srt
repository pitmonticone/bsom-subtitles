00:00:00,779 --> 00:00:02,759
 Hello and welcome to this

2
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:04,590
 new series about multi-

3
00:00:04,869 --> 00:00:06,119
 variable calculus.

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,590
 This will be a video course

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,039
 where I explain things

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,560
 concerning functions

7
00:00:11,569 --> 00:00:13,359
 defined on R^n

8
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,869
 For example, we will talk

9
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,840
 a lot about derivatives like

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,159
 partial derivatives,

11
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,079
 directional derivatives and

12
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,430
 total derivatives.

13
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,579
 However, before we start

14
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,139
 with this, I really want

15
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:27,870
 to thank all the nice people

16
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:29,649
 who make such new video courses

17
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:30,940
 like this possible.

18
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,470
 And there please don't forget

19
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,180
 if you support me on Steady,

20
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:36,819
 you get access to the PDF

21
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,349
 versions and quizzes for

22
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,470
 all the videos.

23
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:41,939
 Speaking of other videos,

24
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,639
 I can tell you it will be

25
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,490
 helpful that first you watch

26
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,139
 my real analysis course

27
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,759
 simply because there we

28
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,029
 discuss the normal

29
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,560
 calculus in one

30
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:53,240
 variable.

31
00:00:54,279 --> 00:00:56,139
 In other words, multivariable

32
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,930
 calculus will extend

33
00:00:57,939 --> 00:00:59,259
 this series here.

34
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:01,779
 However, of course, you don't

35
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,349
 need to understand everything

36
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,099
 in real analysis to start

37
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,500
 with this multivariable

38
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,709
 calculus course.

39
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,980
 Moreover, soon you will

40
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:11,819
 notice that we will extend

41
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,660
 a lot of notions from one

42
00:01:13,669 --> 00:01:15,410
 variable here to several

43
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:16,480
 variables there.

44
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:19,190
 And exactly for this reason,

45
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,919
 also my linear algebra

46
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,510
 course can help you there.

47
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:25,180
 This is what you will understand

48
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,940
 immediately when we write

49
00:01:26,949 --> 00:01:28,529
 down functions from

50
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,300
 R^n to R^m.

51
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,790
 In the linear algebra course,

52
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,510
 such functions would

53
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,139
 be linear functions.

54
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,849
 However, here in multivariable

55
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,739
 calculus, we will consider

56
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,419
 a lot of different functions

57
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,980
 from R^n to R^m.

58
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:46,250
 But still, we will

59
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,709
 ask if we can

60
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,589
 approximate these functions

61
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,069
 with linear functions

62
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,769
 which as you might know from

63
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:55,220
 the one variable case

64
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,779
 leads to the notion of

65
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,860
 derivatives.

66
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,699
 Moreover, you also know

67
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:02,599
 such derivatives can help

68
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,080
 finding maxima and

69
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:05,720
 minima of functions.

70
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,529
 And now with this course,

71
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,320
 we will be able to do this

72
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,160
 for quantities of interest

73
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:13,610
 that depend on several

74
00:02:13,619 --> 00:02:14,360
 factors.

75
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:17,039
 And indeed, you will see

76
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,740
 we have a lot of applications

77
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,320
 for this.

78
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,550
 In addition, this course

79
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:22,919
 now can help you to

80
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:24,720
 understand my more advanced

81
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:25,440
 courses.

82
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:28,039
 Indeed quite fitting after

83
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,929
 this will be my manifolds

84
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,649
 course.

85
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:32,970
 And also functional

86
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:34,589
 analysis will generalize

87
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,199
 a lot of topics from here.

88
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:38,800
 And lastly, I can tell you

89
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:40,679
 if you know how to deal with

90
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,320
 multivariable calculus,

91
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,000
 you also know how to deal

92
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:45,520
 with complex analysis.

93
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:48,119
 So in some sense here, you

94
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,839
 can use a lot of facts for

95
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,649
 functions from R² into

96
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,309
 R².

97
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:53,679
 OK.

98
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,100
 Now I think we can talk a

99
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,600
 little bit about the topics

100
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,080
 you can expect here.

101
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,259
 First, we start very

102
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,000
 simple and talk about

103
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:03,600
 continuous functions.

104
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,160
 So we will extend the definition

105
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:08,119
 of continuity that we

106
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,949
 learned in real analysis.

107
00:03:10,779 --> 00:03:12,570
 Then in a similar sense,

108
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,380
 we will generalize the notion

109
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:16,110
 of a derivative from one

110
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:18,029
 variable. However,

111
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,580
 it turns out there are a

112
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:21,330
 lot of different possibilities

113
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:22,020
 for that.

114
00:03:22,029 --> 00:03:23,440
 And therefore, we will talk

115
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:25,059
 about partial derivatives,

116
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,979
 directional derivatives and

117
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,270
 total derivatives.

118
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,169
 Indeed, we will see all

119
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:32,619
 of these notions will be

120
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,770
 important for us.

121
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,220
 Moreover, by using

122
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:37,889
 these things here, we can

123
00:03:37,899 --> 00:03:39,770
 generalize an important theorem

124
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:41,229
 from real analysis,

125
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,289
 namely Taylor's theorem.

126
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,679
 So I would say this is a

127
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,229
 very important fact

128
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,899
 but also the most

129
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,369
 important fact for multi-

130
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,149
 variable calculus will be

131
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,580
 the implicit function

132
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:54,259
 theorem.

133
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:56,889
 In fact, this is a result

134
00:03:56,899 --> 00:03:58,449
 that is used in a lot of

135
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,369
 applications

136
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:01,639
 and in a similar way, the

137
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:03,429
 next one here is also used

138
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,080
 a lot,

139
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:05,910
 it's the famous method of

140
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,630
 Lagrange multipliers.

141
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:08,839
 OK.

142
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,220
 There we have it, this is

143
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:11,820
 the overview of the course

144
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,190
 and we start in the next

145
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,100
 video with continuity.

146
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,649
 Therefore, I would say let's

147
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,149
 meet there and have a nice

148
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,589
 day.

149
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,390
 Bye.
