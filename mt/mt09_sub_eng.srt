00:00:00,639 --> 00:00:02,509
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,519 --> 00:00:03,750
 measure theory.

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:04,230
 First.

4
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:05,619
 Let me thank all the nice

5
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,300
 supporters on Steady.

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,880
 We have come very far in

7
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,510
 a series and reached now

8
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,949
 part nine,

9
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,600
 I was talking about the very

10
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:17,530
 important convergence theorems.

11
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,090
 And today I want to tell

12
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,549
 you about Fatou's Lemma.

13
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:23,440
 This lemma is much more

14
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,690
 important than it sounds

15
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,450
 first.

16
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:26,959
 However, it's not

17
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:28,700
 quite a convergence theorem,

18
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:30,559
 more or less half a convergence

19
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:32,400
 theorem, but it is

20
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,220
 so general that you can apply

21
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:35,400
 it very often.

22
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,500
 OK.

23
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:38,439
 Then let me explain you

24
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,020
 what the Lemma states.

25
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,580
 As always, we have a measure

26
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,220
 space consisting

27
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:45,900
 of a set, a Sigma

28
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:47,099
 algebra and a measure.

29
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,409
 And we also have a

30
00:00:49,419 --> 00:00:51,349
 sequence of measurable

31
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,189
 functions.

32
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,639
 OK.

33
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,810
 Here I want to write down

34
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:56,500
 the codomain of the functions

35
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:57,759
 and there I have to tell

36
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,759
 you there are different

37
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,639
 possibilities and they

38
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,549
 lead to different variations

39
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,509
 of Fatou's lemma.

40
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,949
 However, I think the best

41
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,910
 way to describe it is again

42
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:09,360
 to choose non-negative

43
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,580
 functions.

44
00:01:11,089 --> 00:01:12,900
 When I say non negative,

45
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,349
 then it's clear that the

46
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,970
 zero is included, but it's

47
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,900
 not clear if infinity

48
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,580
 is included.

49
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,309
 However, here, that's not

50
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:20,720
 a problem.

51
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,110
 We can just include it.

52
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,449
 And now to the statement

53
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:26,650
 of this lemma,

54
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:28,680
 because we are in the realm

55
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,360
 of the convergence theorems,

56
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,120
 the question would be again,

57
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:34,050
 OK, I have integral over

58
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:35,319
 X and a limit

59
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,279
 inside.

60
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,879
 Can I pull out

61
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:38,980
 this limit?

62
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:42,589
 However, Fatou's Lemma

63
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,269
 is a little bit more specific,

64
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:46,150
 it does not look at the limit

65
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:48,319
 rather than at the limit

66
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,199
 inferior.

67
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,750
 Now, Fatou's Lemma claims

68
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:53,489
 that if we look at the limit

69
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,239
 inferior of our sequence

70
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,050
 of functions FN, so

71
00:01:57,059 --> 00:01:57,790
 here's d mu

72
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,230
 then I can pull out the limit

73
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,809
 inferior and then I have

74
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,809
 to limit inferior here of

75
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:07,430
 the numbers given by the

76
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,770
 integrals of FN.

77
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,220
 But we don't have an

78
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:12,679
 equality sign here,

79
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,750
 just an inequality sign.

80
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:16,690
 And Fatou tells us the

81
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:18,429
 left hand side can't be

82
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,809
 bigger than the right hand

83
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,350
 side.

84
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:23,369
 So you see the Lemma is not

85
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,789
 so strong as a convergence

86
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,389
 theorem.

87
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:27,160
 But please note that our

88
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:29,059
 requirements are very weak.

89
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:31,059
 We only need non-negative

90
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,190
 measurable maps.

91
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,059
 Nothing else.

92
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,449
 The actual convergence

93
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,759
 theorem that follows from

94
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,350
 this claim here is Lebegue's

95
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,410
 theorem which we will consider

96
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:42,199
 in the next video

97
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:44,389
 before showing you the proof

98
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,460
 of this nice lemma.

99
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,320
 Let me first explain

100
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,210
 what this new function liminf

101
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,089
 in of the sequence of functions

102
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,169
 actually is.

103
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:54,139
 Well, of course, it is a

104
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:54,960
 function

105
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:57,600
 which means it is

106
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,460
 defined on X

107
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,919
 and maps also

108
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:02,710
 into our non negative

109
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,039
 numbers including

110
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,360
 infinity.

111
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:07,539
 And now I want to give you

112
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,449
 the definition.

113
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,770
 So the functions are defined

114
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:11,490
 for all lower case X.

115
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:14,089
 And now we use what we know

116
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,679
 from the limit inferior.

117
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,309
 It is given by the

118
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,940
 limit of the infima

119
00:03:20,929 --> 00:03:22,809
 but cut it at the beginning.

120
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,029
 So we go from

121
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,339
 N to infinity

122
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,929
 and then we look what happens

123
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,779
 when n goes to infinity.

124
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:33,210
 This is the definition of

125
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,779
 the limit inferior for a

126
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:36,070
 sequence of numbers.

127
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,490
 And here we just have numbers

128
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,759
 because we look at

129
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,750
 FX

130
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,039
 and they will see the lowest

131
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,440
 level that the infimum can

132
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:46,160
 have would be zero.

133
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:48,520
 But in the limit, of

134
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,279
 course, it could go to infinity.

135
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:52,220
 So we also have to include

136
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:53,119
 infinity

137
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:55,259
 also in the case when we

138
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,960
 would exclude infinity

139
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,690
 here because in a limit it

140
00:03:58,699 --> 00:03:59,380
 could happen.

141
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,520
 And because we need the infinity

142
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:03,100
 symbol for this function,

143
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,910
 we can just add it from the

144
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,550
 beginning.

145
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,770
 And of course, it just makes

146
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:08,889
 the claim stronger.

147
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:11,300
 The beauty of this is that

148
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:12,600
 we know that the limit

149
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,070
 inferior is also

150
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,970
 measurable

151
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,209
 simply because you can easily

152
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,959
 show that if you put in

153
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,940
 measurable functions in

154
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,600
 infima are measurable

155
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:24,779
 and also limits of

156
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,179
 measurable functions are

157
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,649
 also measurable

158
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,059
 for the whole proof.

159
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,899
 Now it makes sense to use

160
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,579
 some abbreviations here,

161
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,010
 let's call the limit inferior

162
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:36,820
 just by G of X.

163
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:38,010
 So we have the function G

164
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:39,290
 now and

165
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:41,130
 also these functions

166
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,839
 here given by the

167
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,790
 infima let's call them

168
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:46,529
 GN of X.

169
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,350
 And of course, all the functions

170
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:50,899
 here are measurable

171
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,130
 and we get another information

172
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,730
 out here.

173
00:04:53,739 --> 00:04:55,609
 These functions here are

174
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:57,570
 now monotonically increasing.

175
00:04:58,029 --> 00:04:59,720
 So G one is less or

176
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,190
 equal than G two,

177
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,690
 less or equal than G

178
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,390
 three.

179
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:04,850
 And so on,

180
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:07,130
 this follows immediately

181
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,779
 from the definition of the

182
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,480
 infimum.

183
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,799
 Because if we shift the cut

184
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:13,510
 point and to divide

185
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:15,709
 the inimum can only get bigger,

186
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,839
 not smaller.

187
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:17,989
 OK.

188
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,829
 So we get out a sequence

189
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,109
 that is monotonically

190
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:21,910
 increasing.

191
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:24,029
 And of course, this would

192
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,690
 be very helpful for our proof

193
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,489
 now because we can

194
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,250
 use our convergence theorem,

195
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,390
 we already know.

196
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,790
 And of course, you know,

197
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,589
 it's the monotone convergence

198
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,109
 theorem.

199
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,279
 And indeed, with this, the

200
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,820
 proof is not so long

201
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,100
 on the left hand side, we

202
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:41,540
 have the limit inferior.

203
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,459
 And now I write that as

204
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,209
 the limit of our

205
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:45,989
 GNS

206
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,859
 indeed, that is just our

207
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:49,980
 limit inferior here.

208
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:52,619
 And now we want to pull out

209
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,549
 the limit here.

210
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:56,570
 And you know, now it's allowed

211
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:58,230
 by the monotone convergence

212
00:05:58,619 --> 00:05:58,640
 theorem.

213
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,730
 And we also have the equality

214
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:02,100
 here.

215
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,260
 Please check with the last

216
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:06,109
 videos that we have indeed

217
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:08,079
 satisfied all the requirements

218
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:08,579
 of the theorem.

219
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,380
 Now the next step, I

220
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,140
 substitute the limit

221
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:14,660
 with the limit inferior

222
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,529
 simply because this is the

223
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,760
 thing we want to talk about

224
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:19,559
 in Fatou's Lemma.

225
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,510
 And of course here it's the

226
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,119
 same thing doesn't make any

227
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,140
 difference at all.

228
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,000
 However, in the end, we want

229
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,739
 FN and not GN in the

230
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,609
 integral here.

231
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:33,010
 Therefore, you can ask, what

232
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:34,179
 is the connection between

233
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,709
 G and and FN

234
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,410
 and then you look at the

235
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,829
 definition and see,

236
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:40,640
 OK, the G and is defined

237
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:42,429
 about all FK where

238
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,869
 K is bigger than N

239
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:46,250
 and then you choose the infimum,

240
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,029
 the smallest possible value.

241
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:50,209
 And therefore, of course

242
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,179
 GN is always less or

243
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,790
 equal than FN as

244
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:54,640
 being the infimum.

245
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:57,769
 So let's say that as we

246
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:58,290
 know

247
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,920
 GN, less or equal to FN

248
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:02,640
 for all N and

249
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:03,950
 now you want to use the

250
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,679
 monotonicity of the integral,

251
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,570
 which is a very nice property

252
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:08,809
 of the Lebegue integral.

253
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,630
 So if we have the inequality

254
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,149
 here, then it also

255
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,049
 holds for the integral.

256
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:16,799
 OK.

257
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:18,760
 So this inequality we now

258
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:20,589
 want to use here on the

259
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,519
 right hand side.

260
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,649
 So let me summarize what

261
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,410
 we have here.

262
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,570
 The left hand side is the

263
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:28,890
 limit inferior

264
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:30,690
 inside the integral.

265
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:33,760
 And on the right hand side,

266
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:34,899
 we can use this

267
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,420
 inequality, the limit

268
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:38,040
 inferior, conserve the

269
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:39,940
 inequality, which

270
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,910
 means we have here less or

271
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,239
 equal and limit

272
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,899
 inferior outside

273
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,329
 FNDmu.

274
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,299
 And there we have it that

275
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:53,619
 is Fatou's Lemma.

276
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:57,720
 You see the proof was not

277
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,619
 so hard and not so long because

278
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,480
 we could use our monotone

279
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:02,859
 convergence theorem here.

280
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:04,549
 OK.

281
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:06,260
 So I hope you learned something

282
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:07,940
 today and then you will see

283
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,660
 in the next video how we

284
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,540
 can apply Fatou's lemma.

285
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,359
 And then we can finally prove

286
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,880
 one of my favorite


00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,760
 theorems.

288
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,160
 OK.

289
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,779
 I wish you a very nice day

290
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,239
 and see you next time.

291
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:22,359
 Bye.
