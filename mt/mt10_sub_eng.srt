00:00:00,779 --> 00:00:02,599
 Hello and welcome back

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:04,500
 to measure theory first.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,449
 As always, let me thank all

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,010
 the nice supporters on

5
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:08,619
 Steady.

6
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,380
 I am very happy to see that

7
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,899
 we have already reached

8
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:14,229
 part 10.

9
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:16,520
 And today we will do my

10
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,780
 favorite theory in the

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,379
 integration theory.

12
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:21,270
 And this is Lebesgue's

13
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:23,440
 dominated convergence

14
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,110
 theorem.

15
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,879
 Indeed, the name is quite

16
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:27,860
 fitting because it is as

17
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,780
 before a convergence theorem

18
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,909
 and something has to

19
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,409
 dominate the given

20
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:33,990
 function.

21
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:36,639
 Recall a convergence

22
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,509
 theorem tells you when

23
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,340
 you can pull in a

24
00:00:40,349 --> 00:00:41,680
 limit into the

25
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:42,360
 integral.

26
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:44,610
 It turns out that this

27
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:45,700
 convergence theorem that

28
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:47,560
 is named after Lebesgue is

29
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:49,520
 very useful and you can apply

30
00:00:49,529 --> 00:00:50,319
 it very often

31
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,080
 before I state the theorem,

32
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,630
 let me first start by

33
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:56,520
 introducing some notations.

34
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:59,240
 As always we choose a measure

35
00:00:59,250 --> 00:00:59,560
 space.

36
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:01,380
 So set X and

37
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:03,299
 Sigma algebra A and a measure

38
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:03,689
 mu.

39
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,360
 Now we define a set of Lebesgue-

40
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:08,199
 integrable functions.

41
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:10,019
 Therefore, we use this curved

42
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,680
 L most of the

43
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,540
 time the set X and the Sigma

44
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,230
 algebra are so fixed in the

45
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,730
 context that only the

46
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:18,209
 measure can vary.

47
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:20,610
 And therefore, I just use

48
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,089
 mu here in a notation.

49
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,150
 In other cases, you would

50
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,779
 write the whole measure space

51
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,720
 here inside. The set

52
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,669
 is now defined as

53
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,459
 the set of all Lebesgue-

54
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,809
 integrable functions.

55
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,540
 Now the functions should

56
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,500
 be defined on

57
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,419
 X and have values in

58
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,000
 R.

59
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:40,739
 You could also generalize

60
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,830
 that to complex

61
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:43,309
 values in the end.

62
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,010
 But that's not so hard indeed.

63
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,620
 The important thing however

64
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:47,699
 is that they are

65
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:48,650
 measurable.

66
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,550
 Now, remember we defined the

67
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:53,180
 integral for

68
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,800
 non-negative functions.

69
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:57,019
 And for that reason, I look

70
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,989
 at the integral for the absolute

71
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,930
 value of F, this is a

72
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,150
 non-negative function and

73
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,300
 we know it's still

74
00:02:03,309 --> 00:02:04,269
 measurable.

75
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:06,250
 So we can look at the integral,

76
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,979
 we know this exists in all

77
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,899
 cases, but in the worst case,

78
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,139
 it could be infinity.

79
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,419
 Hence integrable in this

80
00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:16,229
 sense means it's not

81
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,960
 infinity, which means

82
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,779
 less than infinity.

83
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:21,559
 OK.

84
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,770
 So this is the important

85
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:24,660
 set here, the set of

86
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:26,429
 Lebesgue-integrable functions

87
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
 in this sense,

88
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:29,630
 maybe I should give you a

89
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,059
 small remark here,

90
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:33,259
 totally unnecessary in this

91
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,970
 context.

92
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:35,080
 But it will be important

93
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:36,479
 later there.

94
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,839
 You will be interested in

95
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,490
 the power for which the

96
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,350
 function is integrable

97
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:42,419
 this means that you have

98
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,169
 here, the exponent, the power

99
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:44,679
 one.

100
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,660
 And you also put it on

101
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:47,559
 the L

102
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:49,910
 in short, you then call it

103
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,360
 just the L one

104
00:02:51,369 --> 00:02:53,350
 space for such

105
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,789
 functions.

106
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,699
 You can also define the integral

107
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,279
 just by looking at the

108
00:02:57,289 --> 00:02:58,470
 positive and the negative

109
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,229
 part here separately.

110
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,600
 This means that for F in

111
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,970
 our L one

112
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:04,740
 space,

113
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,570
 we write the function F

114
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,440
 as the combination of two

115
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:12,210
 non-negative functions and

116
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,039
 I call this first one F

117
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,869
 plus and the second one

118
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:16,910
 F minus

119
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,179
 and the combination is given

120
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,570
 by a minus sign.

121
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,539
 And, and the idea is F

122
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,199
 plus F minus

123
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,889
 are non-negative.

124
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,339
 OK.

125
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,199
 Maybe a short picture for

126
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:29,690
 this.

127
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,699
 If this is the

128
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,500
 graph of the function F,

129
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:38,320
 then this part here

130
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,440
 is the graph of our function

131
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:41,669
 F plus.

132
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:47,080
 And of course, this part

133
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:48,889
 here then is

134
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:50,619
 the graph corresponding

135
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,869
 to F minus.

136
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,500
 It's not exactly F minus,

137
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:54,550
 this would be

138
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,460
 minus F

139
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,080
 minus.

140
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,029
 However, obviously adding

141
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,669
 both these functions gives

142
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:03,429
 you back our original F.

143
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:06,570
 Now you may immediately believe

144
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,279
 me that for all functions

145
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,970
 F, you can split them up

146
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:11,399
 into these two parts

147
00:04:12,089 --> 00:04:13,740
 in the positive part above

148
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,690
 the X axis.

149
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:16,428
 And the negative part below

150
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,329
 the X axis,

151
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,269
 we have to do this because

152
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:22,058
 we only define the integral

153
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:23,898
 for non-negative functions.

154
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:25,899
 As you remember, the

155
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,299
 idea is then I have an

156
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,140
 integral for F plus

157
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,149
 and also an integral for

158
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,209
 F minus.

159
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,279
 And then I will subtract

160
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,149
 the areas then I

161
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,809
 don't get out the area

162
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,940
 but I get out an orientated

163
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,809
 area where I

164
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,450
 subtract the parts that

165
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:45,269
 lie below the X axis.

166
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,359
 This is the integral notion

167
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:48,100
 we want.

168
00:04:48,109 --> 00:04:49,660
 And we also have this for

169
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,809
 the Riemann integral, as

170
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,579
 you remember.

171
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,420
 Hence, therefore, the definition

172
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:56,209
 is given as the

173
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,140
 following symbol, the integral

174
00:04:58,149 --> 00:04:59,940
 over X for the

175
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,739
 function F dmu

176
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,630
 defined as

177
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,600
 the well-defined integral

178
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:06,700
 of F plus

179
00:05:07,369 --> 00:05:09,339
 has a non-negative function minus

180
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,700
 The well-defined value

181
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,559
 for the integral F minus,

182
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:16,970
 both parts have a

183
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,190
 positive value.

184
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:19,839
 And we also know it's

185
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,709
 finite by this

186
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,589
 assumption here.

187
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,709
 Therefore, the subtraction

188
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,890
 is no problem at all.

189
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,450
 We get out a real number

190
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:27,970
 in the end.

191
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,260
 OK.

192
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:30,839
 Now you know what the integral

193
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,359
 symbol is for measurable

194
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:34,250
 functions with real values.

195
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,029
 I skipped some details for

196
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,179
 the definition of F plus

197
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,970
 and F minus because I think

198
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,160
 the picture is sufficient

199
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:41,410
 here.

200
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,829
 OK.

201
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,200
 Now I can finally

202
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:45,619
 state Lebesgue's

203
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,619
 dominated convergence theorem.

204
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:50,170
 What we need here is a

205
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:52,079
 sequence of functions and

206
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:54,059
 I call it FN defined on

207
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,670
 X and they can

208
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,559
 have real values now

209
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,079
 and of course, they should

210
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:00,390
 be measurable.

211
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:03,230
 Of course, you can visualize

212
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:05,070
 this always as

213
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,769
 sequence of graphs.

214
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,799
 So this would be F one.

215
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,119
 And then the next thing would

216
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,910
 be here as F two

217
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,019
 and then here at F three

218
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:18,279
 and so on.

219
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,899
 For such a sequence of functions

220
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,500
 you can always ask

221
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,260
 about the pointwise limit.

222
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,959
 This means that you fix a

223
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,649
 point X on the X

224
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,390
 axis and

225
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,100
 look at the values for the

226
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:32,589
 functions.

227
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,350
 So you have one value here,

228
00:06:34,609 --> 00:06:35,910
 the next one here.

229
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:37,339
 So you get out a

230
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,230
 normal sequence of

231
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:40,170
 real numbers.

232
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,559
 Therefore, you can ask what

233
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,079
 happens with this

234
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:45,519
 normal sequence of

235
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:46,160
 numbers.

236
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,209
 If it is convergent, you

237
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,140
 get out a limit which is

238
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,859
 then a point here.

239
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:55,579
 In the case, you can do this

240
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,390
 for all X here, you get

241
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,869
 out a lot of points here.

242
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,019
 And indeed, you get out a

243
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:01,720
 new graph and therefore a

244
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,720
 new function.

245
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,200
 And this is the pointwise

246
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:06,309
 limit function.

247
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,070
 And we will call it just

248
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:08,750
 F here.

249
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,070
 And this is what I also want

250
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,890
 to put into the assumptions

251
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,170
 of our theorem here.

252
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,500
 This means that we also have

253
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,750
 our function F here

254
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:19,000
 also with the

255
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,890
 values.

256
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:21,950
 And the following property,

257
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,339
 if we fix a point X

258
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,859
 for all our functions

259
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:28,709
 FN, then this should

260
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,579
 be convergent to

261
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:31,809
 F of X.

262
00:07:33,549 --> 00:07:34,890
 And I told you we want this

263
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:36,850
 property for all

264
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:38,570
 X on the X axis.

265
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:40,209
 So for all lower

266
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,200
 case X in our capital

267
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:44,079
 X, however,

268
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,679
 you know, we are in the realm

269
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,989
 of measure theory,

270
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,250
 this means we don't need

271
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,959
 this property exactly

272
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,700
 everywhere.

273
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,690
 It's sufficient that we have

274
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,440
 it almost everywhere,

275
00:07:56,429 --> 00:07:58,399
 almost always means

276
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,019
 with respect to our measure

277
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:00,709
 mu here.

278
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:03,160
 And in short, we write this

279
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,380
 as mu

280
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,440
 almost everywhere.

281
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:09,589
 Please recall that this

282
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,299
 means exactly that the

283
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:13,170
 set where this does

284
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:14,709
 not hold is a

285
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,040
 set of measure

286
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:16,910
 zero.

287
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,369
 So mu of the set

288
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,809
 is equal to zero.

289
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,420
 OK.

290
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:24,250
 So until now the assumptions

291
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,420
 are not so strange,

292
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,299
 you have a sequence of measurable

293
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:30,100
 functions and also

294
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:32,000
 the pointwise limit of

295
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,010
 this sequence.

296
00:08:33,869 --> 00:08:35,169
 And now you could ask a lot

297
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,669
 of questions are the

298
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,390
 functions integrable?

299
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,169
 So do they lie in our

300
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,289
 L one space.

301
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,419
 And if they do, what about

302
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,859
 our point was estimate function

303
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:46,770
 F then and more

304
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,179
 importantly, can I

305
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,609
 swap the limit

306
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:51,549
 And the integral? Or in

307
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,349
 other words, can I pull

308
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:54,909
 in the limit into the

309
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:55,549
 integral?

310
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,849
 Now Lebesgue's dominated

311
00:08:57,859 --> 00:08:59,669
 convergence theorem says

312
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,469
 yes to all of these

313
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,309
 questions,

314
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,619
 if we add one

315
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,750
 more assumption

316
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:08,479
 and this is where the dominated

317
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:09,599
 comes into the play,

318
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:11,869
 we have that the absolute

319
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,650
 value of all these

320
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:15,039
 functions is

321
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:16,900
 bounded by a function

322
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:17,369
 G.

323
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,030
 Of course, you should read

324
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,320
 this point wisely.

325
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,190
 So if you put in an X

326
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,049
 here, this inequality

327
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:25,679
 holds the

328
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,130
 function G now has the

329
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,520
 property that it is

330
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,260
 integrable, which means it

331
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,849
 comes from our L one

332
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:32,479
 space

333
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:35,679
 and obviously it should be

334
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,419
 the same G for

335
00:09:37,429 --> 00:09:38,159
 all N.

336
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,440
 Now this G is what one

337
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,419
 usually calls an integrable

338
00:09:45,859 --> 00:09:46,909
 majorant.

339
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,520
 So this is what Lebesgue's

340
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,619
 dominated convergence theorem

341
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,570
 indeed needs it needs an

342
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,250
 integrable majorant.

343
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,280
 So a function that

344
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:58,229
 lies above all

345
00:09:58,239 --> 00:09:59,469
 the other functions here.

346
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,929
 This means it's not important

347
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,349
 what exactly the function

348
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,130
 G is.

349
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,479
 You only need this

350
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:07,250
 inequality and you

351
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,049
 need that it's integrable

352
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:10,969
 from these two properties.

353
00:10:10,979 --> 00:10:12,739
 Now, all the other things

354
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,500
 follow, for

355
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,179
 example, if you know

356
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,719
 that G has a finite

357
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:19,630
 integral, then all the

358
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,020
 other functions should be

359
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,960
 also integrable.

360
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:23,950
 OK.

361
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,710
 So let's write that down

362
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:27,630
 as the implication of the

363
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,190
 theorem,

364
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,539
 all the functions F

365
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,520
 one F two

366
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:36,500
 F three and so on

367
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,299
 lie in our

368
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,979
 L one space.

369
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:43,729
 And we can say the same

370
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,380
 for our point west limit

371
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,239
 function F.

372
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,809
 Of course, we know it should

373
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,580
 be measurable as a limit,

374
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:52,469
 but it's also

375
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,099
 integrable.

376
00:10:54,099 --> 00:10:55,369
 Now let's look at the integrals

377
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:56,820
 we know

378
00:10:57,229 --> 00:10:59,179
 for all FN, the

379
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,760
 integral will exist

380
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:02,710
 and defines a real

381
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:03,239
 number.

382
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:05,390
 Therefore, we have here a

383
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,210
 new sequence of real numbers

384
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:09,140
 and we can ask what is the

385
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,700
 limit?

386
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,039
 And the answer is you can

387
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:14,200
 pull the limit

388
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,000
 inside and there we

389
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,440
 have our pointwise limit

390
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,219
 of f_n.

391
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:19,799
 So this is what we called

392
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:20,359
 F

393
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,469
 and that's now Lebesgue's

394
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:24,729
 dominated convergence theorem

395
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,700
 as a convergence theorem,

396
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,669
 it tells you when you are

397
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,549
 allowed to push the limit

398
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,130
 inside the integral.

399
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,099
 And here you see, you just

400
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:37,690
 have to find a suitable

401
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,559
 function G nothing more.

402
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,919
 And that is the reason why

403
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:43,250
 this theorem is so

404
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,099
 useful and you can apply

405
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:45,979
 it very often.

406
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:47,590
 OK?

407
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:49,210
 I hope you're also intrigued

408
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:51,119
 by the theorem as much as I

409
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,830
 am and that you will

410
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,169
 watch the next video in the

411
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:54,830
 series

412
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,340
 where I of course show

413
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,099
 you the whole proof of

414
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:00,820
 this dominated convergence

415
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,309
 theorem.

416
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:04,200
 And after this, I can show

417
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,020
 you a lot of examples

418
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,950
 where Lebesgue's dominated convergence

419
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,780
 theorem is very important.

420
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:10,869
 OK.

421
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,549
 Thank you very much for listening

422
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,789
 and see you next time.

423
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,590
 Bye.
