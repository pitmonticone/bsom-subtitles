00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:02,539
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:03,769
 measure theory.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,000
 We have reached part 5

4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,119
 in our series.

5
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,609
 And today I want to talk

6
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:10,220
 about measurable

7
00:00:10,229 --> 00:00:10,880
 maps.

8
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:13,350
 Now let us immediately

9
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:15,260
 start with the definition.

10
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:17,459
 Of course, we will talk about

11
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:19,280
 the usual map between

12
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:20,200
 two sets.

13
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:22,500
 Let us denote the map by

14
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,459
 F and the two sets by

15
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:26,120
 Omega_1 and Omega_2.

16
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,579
 In addition, both sets

17
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,549
 should also comprise a Sigma

18
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,150
 algebra respectively.

19
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,040
 So let me denote the first

20
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:35,860
 Sigma algebra by A_1

21
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,389
 and the

22
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,229
 second by A_2.

23
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,380
 By now, you know that such

24
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:44,189
 a pair consisting of a

25
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,729
 set with a corresponding

26
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,709
 Sigma algebra is called a

27
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,330
 measurable space.

28
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:51,279
 And you also know that we

29
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,619
 need such a measurable

30
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,380
 space to define a

31
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:55,290
 measure on it.

32
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,709
 However, please note that

33
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,069
 we don't need a measure here.

34
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,740
 We just need the sets

35
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,659
 and the Sigma algebras, nothing

36
00:01:02,669 --> 00:01:03,029
 else.

37
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:05,699
 Now f is called

38
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:06,709
 measurable

39
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,559
 if the following

40
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,500
 holds the

41
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,050
 preimage of a

42
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:13,459
 set coming

43
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,080
 from the Sigma algebra

44
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:16,260
 A_2.

45
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:17,629
 So A_2 is an

46
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:19,039
 element in

47
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,879
 A_2,

48
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:22,680
 is an element

49
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,240
 in the sigma algebra

50
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:25,089
 A_1.

51
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,370
 And this holds for all

52
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,220
 sets from the Sigma

53
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,500
 algebra A_2.

54
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:34,459
 If you remember that we also

55
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,239
 call elements from a sigma

56
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,290
 algebra just

57
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,089
 measurable, then we can

58
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,750
 say a map is

59
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,309
 called measurable,

60
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,230
 if the preimages of

61
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,099
 measurable sets is again

62
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,190
 measurable.

63
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:49,010
 And of course, this could

64
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:50,580
 be confusing if there are

65
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:51,900
 a lot of different sigma

66
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,989
 algebras involved.

67
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:54,779
 Therefore, we would also

68
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,199
 include the sigma

69
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:57,010
 algebras in the

70
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,680
 definition of

71
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,580
 measurable.

72
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:01,349
 So the map f is here

73
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,779
 measurable with

74
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,519
 respect to the two sigma

75
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:05,339
 algebras.

76
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:07,690
 OK.

77
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:09,330
 So this concept seems

78
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:11,020
 meaningful because it connects

79
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:12,860
 the two sigma algebra here in

80
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:13,660
 the definition.

81
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:15,770
 However, of course, you can

82
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:17,350
 ask why do we need

83
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,889
 this?

84
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,610
 And why do we need this

85
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:21,419
 exactly in this fashion

86
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:22,929
 with the preimages?

87
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:25,550
 We can easily explain that

88
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,690
 when we recall why we

89
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:29,169
 do measure theory

90
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,190
 and how we could define

91
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,550
 an integral in the end.

92
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,119
 Therefore, let us look at

93
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,110
 an easy function like from

94
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:37,649
 school, so a one dimensional

95
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,529
 function where you can draw

96
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:40,220
 the graph.

97
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:41,369
 OK.

98
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,899
 So here the function has

99
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,080
 the value zero.

100
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:46,270
 And here I set the value

101
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:46,759
 one.

102
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:49,270
 Now the integral of this

103
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:51,210
 function should be exactly

104
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,130
 the volume of the

105
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,770
 set that is sent to one.

106
00:02:54,779 --> 00:02:56,699
 So you could imagine that

107
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,610
 in this way,

108
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:00,179
 there's the set and this

109
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,669
 is what we want to measure

110
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:02,789
 in our measure.

111
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,699
 So this set here on the

112
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,850
 x-axis is the

113
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:09,199
 preimage of the value

114
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:09,899
 1.

115
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,610
 So exactly this

116
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:13,449
 set here

117
00:03:14,589 --> 00:03:16,270
 and what we need and have

118
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,270
 for the x-axis is just a

119
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,250
 measure space.

120
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:21,380
 So set

121
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,149
 Sigma algebra and

122
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,740
 a measure  mu.

123
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:27,979
 So an abstract measure space

124
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,830
 is enough.

125
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:30,059
 And then we can measure

126
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:32,759
 the volume of this set here.

127
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,470
 Hence, for a meaningful

128
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,220
 integral, we want

129
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:39,169
 to measure sets of

130
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:39,929
 this form.

131
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,339
 However, the measure mu is

132
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,750
 only defined on the Sigma

133
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,380
 algebra.

134
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:46,139
 So what we really need

135
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:47,830
 is that this one is an

136
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:49,740
 element in the Sigma algebra

137
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,100
 on Omega.

138
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:52,690
 So which is here our

139
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:53,259
 A

140
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,389
 and there you see why we

141
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:57,750
 need the preimage in the

142
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,270
 definition, we want to

143
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:01,100
 guarantee that if we have

144
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,990
 a measurable set on the

145
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,539
 y-axis, we also

146
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,330
 get a measurable set

147
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:07,649
 on the x-axis

148
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,839
 and the set on the x-axis

149
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,320
 we get with the preimage.

150
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,270
 And that is what we want

151
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:13,720
 to put in the measure in

152
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:15,339
 the end or to say it

153
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,858
 in a few words, the

154
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:18,600
 definition of measurable

155
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:20,048
 maps solves a

156
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,660
 problem that will come

157
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,589
 later.

158
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:23,929
 OK.

159
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,790
 Then let's talk about a

160
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:26,850
 few examples

161
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:28,420
 now. Then let us

162
00:04:28,429 --> 00:04:29,579
 start with an

163
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:31,320
 abstract measurable

164
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:31,709
 space.

165
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,119
 So Omega,

166
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,950
 A and

167
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,500
 also the

168
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,029
 real number line

169
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,000
 with the Borel Sigma

170
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:40,500
 algebra.

171
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:44,920
 Now one can look at the

172
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:46,440
 common characteristic

173
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,200
 function. Sometimes

174
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:49,989
 also called the indicator

175
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,589
 function.

176
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,859
 And I will always

177
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:56,609
 use the greek letter Chi

178
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,579
 to denote this

179
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,820
 characteristic function.

180
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:02,119
 Namely Chi with an

181
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,059
 index A, where A is

182
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,750
 just a set in Omega.

183
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,660
 So the map goes from Omega

184
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,010
 to the real numbers

185
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:12,220
 and is defined by the

186
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,739
 following two cases.

187
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,809
 By the way, I rather should

188
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,690
 use a lower case omega

189
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,239
 to denote the variable here.

190
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:21,619
 So the two cases then are

191
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,459
 one or zero depending

192
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,010
 if our lower case omega

193
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:26,630
 comes from A

194
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,730
 or not.

195
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,959
 So omega in A is

196
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,910
 one and omega

197
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,359
 not in A

198
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:34,529
 is zero

199
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,570
 from this, we can now

200
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:39,179
 conclude that for

201
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,440
 all measurable

202
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,290
 sets, which means

203
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:44,170
 A in our Sigma algebra

204
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:45,339
 A, the

205
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,169
 characteristic function Chi_A

206
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,059
 is a

207
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,429
 measurable

208
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,089
 map.

209
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,950
 In order to prove this, we

210
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,320
 just have to look at all

211
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:54,489
 the preimages.

212
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,700
 And because we only have

213
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,489
 two values for the function,

214
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,750
 there are not so many

215
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,359
 preimages we could have.

216
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,970
 For example, if you look

217
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,739
 at the preimage of the

218
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,579
 empty set and then of

219
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:08,230
 course, you get out the empty

220
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:09,950
 set and

221
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,549
 the other trivial case

222
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:13,049
 would be looking what the

223
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:14,910
 preimage of the whole real

224
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,589
 number line is and of

225
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,000
 course, what you get out

226
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,450
 is what you put in.

227
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:20,989
 So the preimage is

228
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,910
 here Omega itself,

229
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:24,910
 of course, this is what we

230
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,500
 have for all maps of this

231
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,059
 form.

232
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,239
 So let us look at more

233
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,399
 interesting cases.

234
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,510
 So the preimage

235
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,470
 of for

236
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,320
 example, the set that contains

237
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,109
 only one

238
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,839
 and there we know the

239
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,579
 whole set A

240
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:41,859
 is sent to one.

241
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,380
 So the preimage here is

242
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,820
 exactly A.

243
00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:46,619
 On the other hand, if we

244
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,179
 look at the preimage of

245
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,980
 the set that only contains

246
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:51,619
 zero, then we get

247
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,019
 out everything

248
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,779
 else.

249
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,579
 So not A. Which means

250
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,339
 this is the complement of

251
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,589
 A.

252
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:00,440
 And in fact, these are all

253
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,880
 the preimages we can get

254
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,380
 out.

255
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,369
 So if you choose another

256
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,040
 set here you get one of

257
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,190
 these four sets.

258
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,359
 And important to note here

259
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:09,769
 is of course, yeah,

260
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:11,649
 empty set, omega

261
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,489
 are in the sigma algebra.

262
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,809
 And by assumption our A is

263
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,329
 also the Sigma algebra.

264
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:19,220
 But then by the definition

265
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,600
 of the Sigma algebra, we

266
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:22,070
 also know that the

267
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,619
 complement is also the Sigma

268
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,290
 algebra.

269
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,970
 And please recall that is

270
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,880
 exactly the definition of

271
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,209
 a measurable map.

272
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:32,290
 So you see a characteristic

273
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:33,480
 or an indicator function

274
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:35,290
 is a typical example of a

275
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:36,559
 measurable map.

276
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,109
 And indeed an important one,

277
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:40,799
 because if you look at the

278
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:42,429
 picture here again, these

279
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,010
 are maps that we could

280
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:45,970
 easily integrate if we have

281
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,019
 a notion of integration.

282
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:48,420
 So this is what we will do

283
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:49,750
 in the next videos later.

284
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,059
 However, here we should first

285
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,440
 continue with the next

286
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,220
 example.

287
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:56,410
 Let us choose here three

288
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,119
 measurable spaces.

289
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,149
 We do this because I want

290
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,059
 to look at compositions of

291
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,380
 measurable maps.

292
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:05,459
 In other words, we start

293
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,309
 with the set Omega_1 go

294
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,579
 in Omega_2

295
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,440
 and then in Omega_3.

296
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,660
 let us then call the map

297
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,239
 here by f

298
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:16,160
 and this one should be the

299
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,220
 map g.

300
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,820
 So and then we can do

301
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:20,750
 the composition. Which

302
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,450
 means a map going

303
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:23,950
 from Omega_1

304
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,029
 directly to

305
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,209
 Omega_3.

306
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,869
 And this is then defined

307
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,660
 as g after

308
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,329
 f.

309
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:31,910
 So the composition of both

310
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,758
 maps. The claim is

311
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:35,679
 now, if we put in

312
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:37,558
 two measurable maps,

313
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,419
 then also the composition

314
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,597
 is measurable.

315
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:42,328
 So in short, this

316
00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:44,239
 implies g

317
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:46,018
 after f

318
00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:47,059
 measurable.

319
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,619
 Indeed, this is very easy

320
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,559
 to see if you look again

321
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,739
 at the preimages.

322
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:54,820
 So the preimage of

323
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,659
 g composed with f

324
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:58,650
 of a set

325
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:00,419
 coming from the Sigma

326
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:01,669
 algebra A_3.

327
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,090
 So let's call it A_3

328
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:05,400
 is equal to

329
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,039
 and now we can go

330
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,380
 stepwise.

331
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,210
 So we have

332
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:11,679
 the preimage of g

333
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,480
 first

334
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,900
 of A_3.

335
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:15,460
 So this step and then the

336
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:16,479
 preimage of this.

337
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:19,890
 So this equality holds for

338
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,539
 all maps.

339
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:21,849
 But now we can put in what

340
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:23,530
 we know of f and

341
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:25,440
 g. Maybe first we know

342
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,250
 that g is measurable.

343
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,510
 So we know this one is

344
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,299
 an element in the Sigma

345
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:32,909
 algebra A_2.

346
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,359
 But now we know that f is

347
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:36,900
 also measurable.

348
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:38,130
 So we know that the whole

349
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,659
 thing here now

350
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:41,380
 lies in the Sigma algebra

351
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,289
 A_1 or in other

352
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:44,820
 words, does not matter

353
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,609
 which element from the sigma

354
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,919
 algebra A_3

355
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:49,180
 you choose here the

356
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:51,380
 preimage always lies in

357
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,020
 the sigma algebra A_1.

358
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:55,390
 And this is indeed what

359
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,869
 measurable for maps

360
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,450
 means.

361
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,500
 Well, let's close this video

362
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,059
 with some important facts

363
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,419
 about measurable

364
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:04,229
 functions.

365
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,210
 And when I say function,

366
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:08,119
 I just mean a map that

367
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,570
 maps into the real number

368
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,419
 line. This means

369
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:13,059
 that we now have two

370
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,849
 measurable spaces.

371
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,739
 And one of them is just the

372
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,099
 real number line with the

373
00:10:18,109 --> 00:10:19,520
 Borel Sigma algebra.

374
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,950
 Now let us look at two maps.

375
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,849
 So just functions.

376
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,780
 Let's start with omega

377
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,909
 and land in the real

378
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,700
 number line.

379
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,349
 And of course, they should

380
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:34,030
 now be measurable

381
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,940
 with respect to these two

382
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,179
 Sigma algebras

383
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:39,260
 because we have the whole

384
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,940
 structure of the real

385
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,630
 numbers, we can now

386
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,260
 look at combinations of these

387
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,070
 two functions.

388
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,609
 For example, f +

389
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:49,159
 g and f

390
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:51,039
 - g again will

391
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:52,250
 define functions.

392
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:53,900
 And the result here is they

393
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:55,710
 are still measurable

394
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:57,599
 in the same manner.

395
00:10:57,609 --> 00:10:59,440
 We can look at the multiplication

396
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,140
 of the two functions just

397
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,109
 by multiplying the values

398
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:04,289
 and defining the function.

399
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:05,380
 So as always,

400
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,359
 and this new function is

401
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:09,340
 then again measurable

402
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:12,090
 and also very important

403
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,669
 if you ignore

404
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,039
 negative values, so make

405
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:15,969
 them positive.

406
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,330
 So you get out the absolute

407
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,669
 value as a function.

408
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,510
 This one is also

409
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,510
 measurable.

410
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:24,190
 There are also other important

411
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,099
 combinations one considers

412
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:27,869
 and we will later see if

413
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,650
 we need them.

414
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,049
 However, the idea is always

415
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:31,789
 the same.

416
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,080
 So you can prove this in

417
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,960
 general and use it the whole

418
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:36,640
 time in measure theory.

419
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,030
 OK.

420
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,229
 I think that's good enough

421
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:40,030
 for today.

422
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,030
 So now you learned what a

423
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,710
 measurable map is

424
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:46,609
 and as I promised before,

425
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:48,729
 you will need this definition

426
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:49,929
 when we consider

427
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,270
 integration theory.

428
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,080
 And that is what you will

429
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,619
 see in the next video

430
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,559
 when we indeed start

431
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,909
 with the Lebesgue integral

432
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,859
 then see you next time

433
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:01,239
 there.

434
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,130
 Bye.
