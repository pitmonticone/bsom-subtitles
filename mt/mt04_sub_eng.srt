00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,349
 Hello and welcome back

2
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:03,750
 to measure theory.

3
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:05,789
 This is part four in our

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,550
 series.

5
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:08,489
 And today I will finally

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,479
 explain you why we can't

7
00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:12,189
 define the Lebesgue measure

8
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:13,859
 on the whole power set.

9
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:15,460
 And this should give you

10
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,270
 at least one motivation.

11
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,260
 Why it's so important to

12
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,770
 study the measure theory

13
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:22,680
 for a start here.

14
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,440
 Let me state the measure

15
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,280
 problem again,

16
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:27,940
 we search and measure mu

17
00:00:28,409 --> 00:00:29,799
 on the power set of

18
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:31,530
 R. So as you can see

19
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,849
 this is the one dimensional

20
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,400
 case.

21
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,930
 So we first deal with the

22
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:36,919
 real number line.

23
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,889
 Before we go to higher dimensions,

24
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,130
 we call this the measure

25
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:43,049
 problem because we want

26
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,400
 now two natural

27
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:46,330
 properties that are fulfilled

28
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,580
 by this measure mu

29
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,360
 first, the measure of a

30
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:51,990
 normal interval

31
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,630
 should be just the length

32
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:54,669
 of this interval.

33
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:56,750
 Hence just b

34
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,590
 minus a where I say

35
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:00,290
 that b is of course larger

36
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:00,790
 than a.

37
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,610
 Of course, this is what we

38
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:03,900
 want.

39
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:05,790
 We want to generalize

40
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,720
 the measuring of lengths.

41
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:10,330
 And now the second natural

42
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:12,279
 property is that we have

43
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,220
 some, we call translation

44
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,190
 invariance.

45
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,680
 This means that if we have

46
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,559
 a set A and shift that

47
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:21,160
 by a fixed vector X,

48
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,370
 we don't change the length

49
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,110
 or the measure of the set.

50
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,620
 This means that we get out

51
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,550
 mu of a on

52
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:30,580
 the right hand side here

53
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,559
 and there you have it.

54
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:34,180
 That is what we call our

55
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,319
 measure problem.

56
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,239
 And such a measure mu

57
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,699
 would truly

58
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:40,680
 generalize the length

59
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,239
 measure of intervals.

60
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,860
 However, for more than 100

61
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,720
 years, it is known that

62
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,339
 this measure problem is not

63
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:49,040
 solvable.

64
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,720
 So we can't define such a

65
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,110
 measure mu on the whole

66
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,599
 power set on R.

67
00:01:54,589 --> 00:01:56,059
 Therefore, it makes sense

68
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:57,389
 to build the whole measure

69
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,370
 theory with Sigma algebras.

70
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,199
 In the end, we will see that

71
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,680
 we can choose a suitable

72
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,480
 Sigma algebra where we indeed

73
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:07,239
 can solve this measure problem.

74
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:10,050
 However, in this video, I

75
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:11,809
 start by proving

76
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,990
 that the measure problem

77
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,779
 on the power set does not

78
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:15,570
 have a solution.

79
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:18,240
 The claim I will prove now

80
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,199
 is the following.

81
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:21,389
 Let mu be a measure on the

82
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:23,190
 power set with the property

83
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,149
 one and two, but I will

84
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:26,910
 weaken the property

85
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,960
 one a little bit.

86
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,039
 I just want that the

87
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,529
 measure of the unit

88
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,149
 interval is finite.

89
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:34,869
 So not infinity.

90
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,289
 This is of course fulfilled

91
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,839
 when property one is

92
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,570
 fulfilled.

93
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:42,729
 And why I excluded

94
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,149
 zero in this interval here

95
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,089
 you will see later.

96
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,910
 In addition, mu should now

97
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,789
 also fulfill property

98
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,309
 two, which means it is

99
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,779
 translation invariant.

100
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:55,470
 The result is now that there

101
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,130
 is only one measure that

102
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:58,339
 satisfies this

103
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,830
 and this is the

104
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:01,990
 zero measure.

105
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:04,639
 And of course, the trivial

106
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:06,130
 measure is not what we want.

107
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:07,110
 The trivial measure does

108
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,899
 not fulfill poverty one in

109
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,929
 our measure problem.

110
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,690
 So this explains this

111
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:12,690
 implication here.

112
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,309
 The whole video is now about

113
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,720
 proving this claim.

114
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,839
 And indeed, this is a typical

115
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,720
 exercise you find in

116
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:23,250
 measure theory lectures.

117
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,399
 Therefore, I strongly advise

118
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,660
 you to try for

119
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:28,559
 yourself and then maybe

120
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,440
 fill in the details by

121
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:31,440
 using this video.

122
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:33,339
 And of course, if you're

123
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,179
 not interested in technical

124
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,899
 details, you can happily

125
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,800
 skip this video and go to

126
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:40,539
 the next one in the series

127
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:42,380
 for everyone else.

128
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,179
 Now comes the proof,

129
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:46,309
 I will structure it a little

130
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,660
 bit.

131
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:48,240
 So I start with a, by

132
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,759
 giving some definitions,

133
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,360
 we will study the interval

134
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:53,449
 where we know that the measure

135
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,110
 is finite.

136
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,779
 So this is what I call

137
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:57,070
 capital I,

138
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,490
 which means the unit interval

139
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,410
 where I exclude the zero

140
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:02,679
 and include the one.

141
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,300
 And on I, I now

142
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:07,240
 define an equivalence

143
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:07,820
 relation.

144
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,210
 And this equivalent equivalence

145
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,160
 should ignore rational

146
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,960
 numbers inside the interval

147
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,279
 which means I

148
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,940
 define X and

149
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,829
 Y as equivalent

150
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,178
 if and only if the

151
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,269
 following holds

152
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,859
 the difference between both

153
00:04:25,869 --> 00:04:27,809
 of them is only a rational

154
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,269
 number.

155
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:31,109
 So X minus

156
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:32,880
 Y is in

157
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,399
 Q,

158
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,510
 this means that we don't

159
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,190
 want to distinguish

160
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,940
 numbers that only differ

161
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,230
 by a rational number.

162
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,619
 We want to deal with these

163
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,220
 numbers as the same.

164
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,109
 Therefore, the equivalence

165
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,010
 class of such an X can

166
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,380
 be written as X

167
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,049
 plus.

168
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:51,820
 All rational numbers

169
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:52,480
 are.

170
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:54,619
 So we put all these numbers

171
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,570
 in one box and call it

172
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:58,109
 the X with the brackets.

173
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:00,480
 However, keep in mind, we

174
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:02,160
 define the equivalence relation

175
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,369
 on our set.

176
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,239
 I, so now we just

177
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,130
 live on the unit interval.

178
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,760
 Therefore, these numbers

179
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:10,160
 should also live on the unit

180
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:10,660
 interval.

181
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,679
 Therefore, I have to add

182
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,329
 here that also X

183
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:16,109
 plus R lies

184
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:18,089
 still in the unit level.

185
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,619
 So I can't add a

186
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,260
 big rational numbers because

187
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:22,410
 then I would leave the unit

188
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:22,850
 level.

189
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,850
 Otherwise now we hit

190
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:26,630
 all the numbers we want

191
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,929
 there.

192
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,230
 We have the well-defined

193
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:30,529
 equivalence relation with

194
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,040
 the well-defined equivalence

195
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:33,750
 classes to give

196
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,190
 some visualization.

197
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:37,209
 I may draw these boxes

198
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,950
 for real.

199
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,910
 They are sets, sets with

200
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,649
 elements.

201
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,549
 So I could call this

202
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:45,540
 X one and I have

203
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:46,250
 one box here,

204
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:50,059
 then I have another one.

205
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,010
 So this would be X two,

206
00:05:54,369 --> 00:05:55,859
 X three and X

207
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:56,549
 four.

208
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:58,579
 And of course, this picture

209
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:00,410
 goes on for

210
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,149
 forever.

211
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:02,790
 We don't know if we have

212
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:04,790
 countable many boxes as the

213
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,269
 picture suggests here.

214
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,670
 So please be careful.

215
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,000
 But we know that we have

216
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,880
 a disjoint decomposition

217
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,029
 of the unit interval.

218
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,929
 This is what we always have

219
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,579
 if we define an

220
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:17,670
 equivalence relation.

221
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,160
 Now we already reached the

222
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,519
 essential part of the

223
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:24,179
 proof because we

224
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,880
 define a set

225
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,440
 A in

226
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,209
 I that describes

227
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,619
 all these boxes

228
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,220
 that means each element

229
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,859
 A describes or

230
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:36,390
 represents exactly

231
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,059
 one of these boxes.

232
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:40,070
 And this picture would look

233
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,940
 like OK, I choose

234
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,200
 one element here.

235
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:45,149
 Maybe I call this a one,

236
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:47,049
 then I go to the next box,

237
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:49,040
 I pick an element A two.

238
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,239
 Here I pick out an element

239
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,000
 A three here, a

240
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,910
 four and so on.

241
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,059
 And then I put all

242
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,570
 these elements in a

243
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:00,299
 set and this is

244
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:02,089
 what I call the set

245
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,600
 A,

246
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:05,480
 this looks nice now.

247
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:07,029
 But keep in mind if we have

248
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,730
 uncountable many boxes,

249
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:10,480
 this picture is not the

250
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:12,239
 correct way to represent

251
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:12,720
 this.

252
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,970
 And therefore we need another

253
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,600
 definition for set A.

254
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,880
 But of course, with exactly

255
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,589
 the same idea behind

256
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:22,239
 the first property is therefore

257
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,690
 for each box.

258
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,109
 So for each equivalence class

259
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:26,890
 X, I find such an

260
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:28,359
 a in A,

261
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:30,760
 this just means picking

262
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:32,760
 out an element A out

263
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:33,559
 of the box.

264
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:35,769
 And then the second property

265
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:37,519
 should tell us that this

266
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:38,779
 element is unique.

267
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,529
 So I only choose one

268
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,279
 element of each box.

269
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,920
 So for all A B and

270
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:46,179
 A, we have the

271
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,920
 property that A

272
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:49,739
 and B come out of the

273
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,140
 same box X,

274
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:54,600
 we can imply

275
00:07:55,049 --> 00:07:56,910
 that A is equal

276
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,510
 to B.

277
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,769
 Hence the definition tells

278
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,519
 us that the set A

279
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:03,279
 has exactly one

280
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,239
 representative out of

281
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,269
 each box.

282
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,799
 The equivalence classes are

283
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:10,109
 therefore exactly

284
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:11,869
 represented by the set

285
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,350
 A.

286
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:14,630
 However, it's not clear how

287
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,470
 to do this representation.

288
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,980
 You don't find a

289
00:08:18,989 --> 00:08:20,809
 construction how we can

290
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,100
 find the set A.

291
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:23,630
 It looks very nice in the

292
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,250
 picture.

293
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,690
 And there you might see we

294
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,540
 have a lot of possibilities

295
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,329
 to define such a set A

296
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,480
 But keep in mind if we are

297
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:33,250
 in the uncountable picture,

298
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,169
 we might not know if such

299
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,849
 a set A could

300
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:37,650
 exist.

301
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,479
 And indeed, this justification

302
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:41,880
 is very strong here.

303
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:44,460
 What we need here is indeed

304
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,309
 the axiom of choice

305
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,039
 that is given in the set

306
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:48,549
 theory.

307
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:50,960
 Therefore, it's an axiom

308
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:52,440
 that guarantees the

309
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,320
 existence of such a set A

310
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,640
 with exactly these two

311
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,400
 properties.

312
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:57,799
 OK.

313
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:58,859
 That was a lot.

314
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:00,849
 But we are still not finished

315
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:02,229
 with all the definitions

316
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:03,210
 I want to give.

317
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:04,809
 Now we have fixed the set

318
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,530
 A and now I want to shift

319
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:07,489
 it a little bit.

320
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,190
 So I translated by a

321
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,010
 rational number.

322
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,340
 So this is what I define

323
00:09:11,349 --> 00:09:12,690
 as A N.

324
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,739
 So this would be

325
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,719
 RN plus the

326
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:17,690
 set A and

327
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,369
 RN is a rational number.

328
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,200
 More concretely, I want a

329
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,690
 sequence RN.

330
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:24,479
 So this goes over the natural

331
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:25,979
 numbers that

332
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,039
 enumerate the whole rational

333
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:28,650
 numbers.

334
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,010
 That's not completely correct.

335
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,239
 I just want an

336
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,760
 enumeration of rational

337
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,320
 numbers intersected

338
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,010
 with the real

339
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,929
 interval minus one

340
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,960
 till one.

341
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,710
 And of course, why I want

342
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,159
 that you will see later.

343
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,590
 However, you should see that

344
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:48,299
 we can use that the rational

345
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:50,239
 numbers accountable when

346
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,780
 we want to apply the sigma

347
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:52,849
 additivity later.

348
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,080
 And now we can finally go

349
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,859
 over to part B of

350
00:09:57,869 --> 00:09:58,520
 my proof.

351
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,750
 First, we show here that

352
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,460
 the sets are here defined

353
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:04,349
 are indeed disjoint.

354
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:06,099
 So we have a

355
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:07,669
 intersected with

356
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,549
 AM and this gives

357
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,190
 you the empty set

358
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,250
 if N is

359
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,739
 not equal to M,

360
00:10:15,859 --> 00:10:17,640
 the proof works easily

361
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,049
 by contraposition.

362
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:20,469
 This means you could read

363
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:21,710
 this one here as an

364
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:22,630
 implication.

365
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:24,049
 So if N is

366
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:26,039
 unequal M, this

367
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:27,960
 implies that

368
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:29,799
 this sets are disjoint.

369
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,479
 Now contraposition now

370
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:33,140
 means OK, they are not disjoint

371
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,799
 and this implies

372
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,130
 N equals M.

373
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:37,849
 So this is logically

374
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:38,539
 equivalent,

375
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:41,130
 however, not being disjoint

376
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,489
 means there is an element

377
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,409
 we can choose out of this

378
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:45,130
 intersection.

379
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,239
 So that's what we do.

380
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:49,349
 And this implies

381
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:51,349
 immediately to properties

382
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,669
 being in A N means

383
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:55,099
 I can write X

384
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:56,710
 as rn

385
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,830
 plus some, well, the

386
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,419
 lower case a in A so

387
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:03,219
 I have an A here or

388
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,150
 being in A_m means I

389
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,359
 can write it as

390
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:07,450
 r_m

391
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,130
 plus some a.

392
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:11,130
 But of course, these could

393
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,830
 be two different A's.

394
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,349
 So I also give you an

395
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:15,919
 index to say

396
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:17,890
 this, OK.

397
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,700
 But of course, the X is the

398
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,619
 same on the left.

399
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,969
 So I can equal them.

400
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:24,150
 This means that I have

401
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,710
 RN plus A

402
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,690
 N equals two,

403
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,950
 two RM

404
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,380
 plus AM.

405
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:32,890
 And there you see what I

406
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,859
 can do is put all

407
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:36,789
 the A's on the one side and

408
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,109
 all the RS on the other side.

409
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:40,349
 And now on the right, we

410
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:42,109
 subtract two rational numbers.

411
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,109
 So you know what comes out

412
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:45,950
 is also a rational number.

413
00:11:46,729 --> 00:11:48,309
 Now remind yourself that

414
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,059
 we defined an equivalence

415
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,780
 relation exactly

416
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:53,150
 when the difference of two

417
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,650
 numbers is a rational number.

418
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,859
 So in other words, a_n and

419
00:11:56,869 --> 00:11:58,109
 a_m are now

420
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:00,020
 equivalent or

421
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,969
 to put this.

422
00:12:00,979 --> 00:12:02,469
 In other words, we could

423
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:04,219
 also say our A

424
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:05,900
 N is in the

425
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:07,250
 equivalence class

426
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:08,919
 represented by

427
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:09,590
 AM.

428
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,900
 If you want, you could also

429
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:13,479
 now add AM

430
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:14,520
 here as well.

431
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,219
 So of course, am is also

432
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:17,369
 in the equivalence class

433
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:17,719
 here.

434
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,849
 And then you see we have

435
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:21,719
 property two for

436
00:12:21,729 --> 00:12:23,590
 set A and it tells

437
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:25,429
 you if two elements come

438
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,070
 out of the same box or the

439
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,510
 same equivalence class, they

440
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,429
 have to be the same.

441
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,789
 So the conclusion here is

442
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,679
 a_n is equal

443
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,750
 to a_m.

444
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,359
 OK.

445
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:38,159
 So this tells us the left

446
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:39,599
 hand side here is zero,

447
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,299
 but then also the right hand

448
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:42,159
 side is zero.

449
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:44,440
 And therefore, we can again

450
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,000
 imply that

451
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,320
 also the rational numbers

452
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,289
 here are the same.

453
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,039
 So RN is equal

454
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:51,940
 to RM but

455
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,520
 the R MS were chosen

456
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,250
 as an enumeration of the

457
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,280
 rational numbers.

458
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:58,039
 And therefore here also

459
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,440
 the indices have to

460
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,260
 coincide

461
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,989
 and this proves now the claim

462
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,190
 by contraposition

463
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:05,789
 very good.

464
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,359
 Now I want to go over to

465
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,229
 the next part.

466
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,200
 In part C I want to look

467
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,570
 at the union of

468
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,460
 these disjoint

469
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:15,049
 sets.

470
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,530
 So I have

471
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,080
 union n

472
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,190
 over N,

473
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:21,630
 OK.

474
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,789
 Now keep in mind what the

475
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,719
 definition of A was that

476
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:26,309
 was defined by our set

477
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,080
 A that lives in the unit

478
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,859
 interval, shifted by

479
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:31,830
 rational numbers that live

480
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,630
 in minus 1 to 1.

481
00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:35,789
 This means by using the

482
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,669
 union, I still should not

483
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,289
 be able to leave the

484
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:40,109
 interval.

485
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,090
 That is given by minus

486
00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:43,869
 one and now I

487
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,390
 shift one with

488
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,690
 maximum one.

489
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,229
 So here I have two.

490
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,919
 And on the other side, you

491
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:52,369
 can use how we

492
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,549
 defined a.

493
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,500
 So this was

494
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,580
 representation of all the

495
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,299
 equivalence classes and where

496
00:13:58,309 --> 00:13:59,549
 the equivalence classes were

497
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,929
 defined by the

498
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,330
 differences with the rational

499
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:03,000
 numbers.

500
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,229
 And now I add

501
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,159
 back all the rational numbers.

502
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:08,960
 So I should

503
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:10,880
 get at least the unit interval

504
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,880
 out again.

505
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:13,780
 OK.

506
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:15,590
 So this one is to claim

507
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,450
 we should prove here in part

508
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,119
 C.

509
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,250
 However, I already

510
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,780
 told you most of the things

511
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:22,250
 you need.

512
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,729
 Therefore, I think it's not

513
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,090
 hard for you to do the proof

514
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:26,859
 for yourself.

515
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,609
 So the proof is an

516
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:30,460
 exercise for you just

517
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,219
 put all the ideas I gave

518
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:34,000
 you now into formulas,

519
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,510
 OK?

520
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,450
 With all these parts in mind,

521
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:39,489
 I can now go to the core

522
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,369
 of the proof, we

523
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,419
 now assume

524
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:44,570
 that we have a measure on

525
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,969
 the whole power set of the

526
00:14:45,979 --> 00:14:46,690
 real line.

527
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,570
 And it also should fulfill

528
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,210
 the two properties we have

529
00:14:50,219 --> 00:14:51,609
 given in the claim.

530
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:54,440
 And now we can use all the

531
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,369
 things above, for example,

532
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,390
 by our translation

533
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,349
 invariance (2), we

534
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,210
 can write that

535
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:03,119
 the measure

536
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,179
 of a

537
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:07,169
 ARN plus

538
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:09,010
 A is the same as the

539
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,809
 measure of

540
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,289
 A.

541
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,450
 And this holds for all

542
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,010
 natural numbers N.

543
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,950
 And maybe let us, you see

544
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,799
 here immediately, we know

545
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,799
 that the measure is always

546
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:23,489
 monotonic, which

547
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,140
 means the measure of

548
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,090
 this set is less or

549
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:28,359
 equal than the measure of

550
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:29,159
 this set.

551
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:30,359
 And this is less or equal

552
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:31,130
 than the measure of this

553
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,549
 set.

554
00:15:32,229 --> 00:15:33,859
 So we have exactly this

555
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:34,989
 inequality here.

556
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,229
 We need it later again.

557
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,869
 So I call the inequality

558
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,409
 here by star.

559
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,369
 Before we go further, let

560
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,239
 us use now our second

561
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,169
 condition here that the

562
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,950
 measure of the unit interval

563
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,609
 is at least finite.

564
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,609
 Let us give this number a

565
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,169
 name.

566
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:54,940
 So I write the measure of

567
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,090
 01

568
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:57,950
 equals to

569
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,530
 number and I call it just

570
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:00,570
 capital C.

571
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:02,590
 With this, we can indeed

572
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:04,539
 calculate the measure here.

573
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,479
 We can use the properties

574
00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:08,150
 of a measure namely the

575
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,359
 Sigma Additivity.

576
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,289
 So I split the set

577
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:12,659
 into unit

578
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:14,609
 intervals or shifted unit

579
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:15,390
 intervals.

580
00:16:15,989 --> 00:16:17,849
 Here I go to zero and include

581
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:18,179
 it.

582
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,849
 And then I have a disjoint

583
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:21,669
 unit when I exclude

584
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,419
 the zero here and go

585
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:24,679
 to one

586
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,119
 included here

587
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,599
 again, union

588
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:29,869
 one and he had

589
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,340
 two.

590
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:32,809
 OK.

591
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,270
 And here we can now use the

592
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,489
 Sigma additivity.

593
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,969
 Now you can write this as

594
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:38,260
 measure of this set plus

595
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,380
 measure of this set plus

596
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,580
 measure of this set.

597
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,530
 And by using the

598
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:43,969
 translation invariance in

599
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:45,770
 two, you know all this

600
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,530
 measure have the same value

601
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:48,830
 namely C

602
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:50,780
 hence we have C plus C

603
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:51,609
 plus C.

604
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:53,059
 So we

605
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:53,729
 c

606
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:55,750
 OK.

607
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,580
 Very good.

608
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,869
 Now, I want to use this in

609
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,799
 the quality I called star

610
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:01,570
 before.

611
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,958
 So this one, what

612
00:17:05,968 --> 00:17:07,019
 you should see immediately

613
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:08,558
 now is that on the left we

614
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:10,368
 have C itself but on the

615
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:11,999
 right we now calculate three

616
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:12,388
 C.

617
00:17:12,989 --> 00:17:14,310
 So let us write it down.

618
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,040
 So I have C less so

619
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,050
 equal then.

620
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:19,050
 And now I can use the Sigma

621
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,050
 additivity as always

622
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,510
 because this one is

623
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,329
 disjoint.

624
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,410
 Now this was part B

625
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,400
 from before.

626
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,510
 So I have now here the

627
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,459
 sum or the series

628
00:17:30,469 --> 00:17:31,890
 from one to

629
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,729
 infinity

630
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,390
 of mu of

631
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,109
 A N and this is

632
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,969
 less for equal than three

633
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:40,790
 times C.

634
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:43,729
 And now we also know that

635
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:45,530
 we can get rid of the

636
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,530
 N here because

637
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,410
 here you see it, this is

638
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:49,910
 a N.

639
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:52,349
 So the translated

640
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:54,270
 version of A but by

641
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,500
 translation invariance, we

642
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,650
 know the measure is the same.

643
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,180
 So we can write mu

644
00:17:58,189 --> 00:17:59,869
 of A on this case.

645
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,869
 And I want to write that

646
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,500
 down as the important

647
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,459
 inequality here.

648
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:06,229
 So C less or

649
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:08,089
 equal the series of

650
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:09,790
 MU A and less or equal than

651
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,569
 three C.

652
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,609
 So please look

653
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:14,260
 closely at this

654
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,390
 inequality.

655
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,260
 You see a fixed number

656
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,219
 mu of A in the middle and

657
00:18:19,229 --> 00:18:20,180
 then the series

658
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,219
 then you know the series

659
00:18:22,229 --> 00:18:23,680
 will explode, it gives you

660
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:25,250
 infinity if

661
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,939
 mu of A is greater than

662
00:18:26,949 --> 00:18:27,479
 zero.

663
00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:29,510
 So the only possible

664
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,199
 case when this is finite

665
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:32,890
 needs mu of A

666
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,140
 equals to zero.

667
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,800
 And this is the case because

668
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,540
 we know that C is

669
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,160
 less than infinity.

670
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:41,599
 So the series has to be

671
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:43,550
 convergent by

672
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,930
 this calculation, we now

673
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:46,930
 can conclude that the measure

674
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:48,920
 of our set A has to be

675
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:49,489
 zero.

676
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,530
 However, this means now the

677
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,449
 value of the series is

678
00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:56,000
 zero.

679
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,760
 So we have zero in the middle

680
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,319
 and left and right, we have

681
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:00,400
 C and three C.

682
00:19:00,449 --> 00:19:02,209
 So there's also no other

683
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:04,099
 possible way other

684
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,660
 than C to be

685
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,180
 zero.

686
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,979
 However, remind yourself

687
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:10,780
 that C was just a short

688
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,180
 notation for the measure

689
00:19:12,189 --> 00:19:13,180
 of the unit interval.

690
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,770
 Hence, this measure

691
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,689
 is also just

692
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:18,390
 zero.

693
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,239
 And indeed, this helps us

694
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,079
 now calculating the

695
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:25,489
 measure of the whole real

696
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,160
 line just

697
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,760
 because I have translation

698
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,369
 invariance and sigma

699
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,969
 additivity.

700
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:33,290
 So we split the real

701
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,109
 line into unit

702
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,469
 intervals and shift them.

703
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,160
 So what we can do is

704
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,530
 just use an interval

705
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,949
 starting with an integer

706
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,939
 M and then go to M

707
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:43,550
 plus one.

708
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,359
 And if I use the union here,

709
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:47,790
 which is then the disjoint

710
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,680
 union where M goes over

711
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,420
 all integers, I

712
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,359
 have what I want.

713
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:54,239
 Now I use Sigma additivity

714
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:56,020
 and then translation variances

715
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,030
 and then I get also

716
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,869
 out adding up zero

717
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,119
 stays at zero.

718
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:03,560
 This now means that the

719
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,300
 volume or length of the

720
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,040
 whole line measured in mu

721
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,550
 is just zero.

722
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:10,670
 So we are dealing with the

723
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:12,780
 real measure this zero measure.

724
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,579
 And in fact, this is what

725
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:17,709
 we wanted to prove.

726
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:21,890
 And there we have it the

727
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,670
 full proof how to

728
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,089
 see that the measure

729
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,550
 problem is not

730
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,250
 solvable.

731
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:29,359
 I know it was a long

732
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,400
 proof with a lot of technical

733
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,400
 details, but I hope you learn

734
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,160
 something here

735
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,050
 and maybe I should close

736
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,920
 this proof with some

737
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,209
 interpretation of the whole

738
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:42,189
 thing you saw

739
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,900
 that it is possible to

740
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,680
 construct such a set

741
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:47,390
 a where we

742
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,089
 can't have a reasonable

743
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:50,469
 length or measure,

744
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:52,979
 we would get contradictions

745
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,569
 if we're not dealing with

746
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:56,530
 the trivial zero measure.

747
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,189
 So the only possibility

748
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:00,579
 to deal with such

749
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:02,119
 sets that behave so

750
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,060
 strangely that we can't measure

751
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:06,060
 them is to exclude them

752
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:07,020
 from the beginning.

753
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,089
 We won't measure all

754
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:10,530
 possible subsets.

755
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,810
 We just deal with sets, we

756
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:14,359
 then call the measurable

757
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:14,890
 sets.

758
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:17,349
 Now these are the sets that

759
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,900
 behave nicely

760
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,630
 enough such that we

761
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,189
 can solve the measure

762
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,060
 problem in this so

763
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:25,369
 called Sigma algebra then .

764
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:27,920
 In fact, the Borel Sigma

765
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,819
 algebra you learned in

766
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:31,510
 part two of the series about

767
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,449
 is a correct choice to

768
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,869
 solve the measure problem.

769
00:21:35,689 --> 00:21:37,390
 We will go into details

770
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,109
 about this in the future.

771
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,920
 But first in the next videos,

772
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,589
 I want to talk about

773
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:44,310
 maps that preserve

774
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,709
 our measurable structure

775
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:46,109
 here.

776
00:21:46,229 --> 00:21:47,890
 So these are so called

777
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,069
 measurable maps.

778
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,109
 OK.

779
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,540
 Then see you in the next

780
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:51,959
 video.

781
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:52,739
 Bye.
