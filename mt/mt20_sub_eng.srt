00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:02,529
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,539 --> 00:00:04,210
 new video about measure

3
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:04,900
 theory.

4
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,369
 And as always, I want to

5
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,069
 thank all the nice people

6
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:09,270
 that support this channel

7
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:10,829
 on Steady.

8
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,520
 In this,

9
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:13,050
 and in the next videos I

10
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,840
 want to talk about so called

11
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:15,939
 outer measures.

12
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,430
 And with this topic, we come

13
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,030
 back to the foundations of

14
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,979
 measure theory.

15
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:23,709
 In fact, after using CarathÃ©odory

16
00:00:24,409 --> 00:00:26,159
 extension theorem, many

17
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,000
 times, I now want to

18
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,959
 actually prove it. In

19
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:30,950
 order to do that,

20
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:32,909
 we need some suitable tools

21
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,770
 and we find out that the

22
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:36,470
 outer measures are indeed

23
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,909
 these important tools.

24
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,450
 For this reason, I can tell

25
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:42,270
 you that for understanding

26
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:44,119
 the idea of measure theory,

27
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:45,490
 you don't really need the

28
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,700
 outer measures at all.

29
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:48,310
 But if you want to go into

30
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:49,869
 the technical details and

31
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,389
 maybe prove such an important

32
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,090
 theorem here, then you can't

33
00:00:53,099 --> 00:00:54,380
 avoid the outer measures.

34
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,340
 The name comes from the circumstance

35
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,200
 that one wants to approximate

36
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:00,939
 a set from the outside.

37
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,220
 But we will talk about this

38
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,720
 later.

39
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,849
 However, in this context,

40
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,760
 I should emphasize that both

41
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:08,540
 words here are connected.

42
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,400
 Outer measure is indeed a

43
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,339
 new notion.

44
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,610
 What I want to tell you here

45
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,510
 is that "outer" is

46
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,989
 not an attribute for

47
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,540
 measure. In

48
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,260
 particular,

49
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:20,930
 it's important to note that

50
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,660
 outer measures don't have

51
00:01:22,669 --> 00:01:24,480
 to be measures in the

52
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:25,220
 usual sense.

53
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,580
 With this heads up at the

54
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:29,319
 beginning, I can however

55
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,769
 reassure you that the

56
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:32,300
 construction of such outer

57
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:34,160
 measures is not so complicated

58
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:34,599
 at all.

59
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,099
 Basically, I would say it's

60
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,680
 even easier than for the

61
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,580
 usual measures we had before

62
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,190
 because we don't need a Sigma

63
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:43,220
 algebra at the beginning.

64
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:44,550
 OK.

65
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:45,730
 I don't want to keep you

66
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,099
 in suspense any longer,

67
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,230
 and therefore I present now

68
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,150
 the definition.

69
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:53,260
 Not so surprising,

70
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:55,019
 also an outer measure is

71
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:56,629
 first of all just a

72
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:58,180
 map defined

73
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,819
 on some subsets

74
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,540
 of a chosen fixed set

75
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,019
 X.

76
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,970
 Indeed admissible are now

77
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,889
 all subsets of X,

78
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,169
 and, therefore, we can choose

79
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:08,970
 the power set.

80
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,008
 And for the values we are

81
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,970
 already used to choose the

82
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:14,449
 non-negative numbers where

83
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,690
 we include the symbol

84
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:16,529
 infinity.

85
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:19,460
 Now, such a map which I

86
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,220
 now denote by Phi

87
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:22,479
 to distinguish it from a

88
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,979
 normal measure, which we

89
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,619
 would denote by mu is

90
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,399
 called an outer measure if

91
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,050
 the following three conditions

92
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:29,860
 are fulfilled.

93
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,089
 So please don't forget that

94
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,690
 we always want to generalize

95
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:35,449
 or abstract how the

96
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,259
 normal measuring of volumes

97
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,479
 in space would work.

98
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,649
 Therefore, we would never

99
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,160
 demand any crazy

100
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:43,729
 properties from this function

101
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,360
 phi here.

102
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,539
 Hence the first property

103
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,449
 you already know if we put

104
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,350
 in the empty set in the map,

105
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,809
 we must get out zero.

106
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:55,449
 The empty set should not

107
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,720
 have any volume.

108
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:59,110
 Also the next property makes

109
00:02:59,119 --> 00:02:59,410
 sense

110
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:01,130
 in this picture. If we look

111
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,929
 at a subset A of

112
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,059
 another set B

113
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:06,570
 and maybe we visualize that

114
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,139
 first here in the picture.

115
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:09,690
 So we have to set X, we have

116
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:11,580
 a subset B inside of the

117
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:13,320
 set and there are

118
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,080
 also a subset A

119
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,399
 inside of B.

120
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:19,199
 What does this mean for the

121
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,020
 volumes?

122
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:21,639
 Of course, the volume of

123
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:23,559
 A should be smaller or in

124
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,139
 the best case, the same as

125
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:26,199
 the volume of B.

126
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,059
 So we have here less or

127
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,820
 equal.

128
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:32,820
 And that is what we call

129
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,820
 the monotonicity of the outer

130
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,279
 measure.

131
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,869
 Please note this property

132
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,869
 we also had for an ordinary

133
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,350
 measure.

134
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,070
 It was just something we

135
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,710
 didn't demand in the definition

136
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,029
 because it followed from

137
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,990
 the other properties.

138
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,729
 And now the third property

139
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,320
 is something you might also

140
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,089
 recognize.

141
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:53,509
 Let's take a sequence of

142
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,169
 subsets,

143
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:56,020
 so let's call them A

144
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:57,630
 one, A two and so on

145
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:59,389
 from the power set

146
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,240
 of X.

147
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:02,639
 And for this sequence then

148
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:04,639
 holds that the union

149
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:06,850
 measured with our map

150
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,740
 phi

151
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,639
 is smaller or equal

152
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,419
 than when we add up

153
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:13,740
 all the volumes

154
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,649
 separately.

155
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:16,760
 This is now something that

156
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,238
 we also can easily

157
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,670
 visualize in this picture

158
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:20,040
 here.

159
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:22,239
 So if we form the union

160
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,829
 of both A one and A

161
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,350
 two, well, we

162
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:27,320
 calculate the area here

163
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,440
 which is of course

164
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,019
 smaller than

165
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:31,640
 adding the volume or the

166
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:33,380
 area here for A one

167
00:04:33,429 --> 00:04:35,230
 plus the area of A

168
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:37,000
 two simply because

169
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,399
 we add this intersection

170
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,359
 two times.

171
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,760
 You see, we don't need

172
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:43,380
 disjoint sets here, which means

173
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,079
 we can have intersections

174
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:46,519
 and they occur on the right

175
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:47,179
 hand side.

176
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,730
 So in general, we will

177
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:50,390
 have an inequality in

178
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,140
 general here.

179
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,200
 And because we have it for

180
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,959
 countable many subsets,

181
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,440
 you see, we have an index

182
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,619
 in the natural numbers N.

183
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,489
 here, we call it the

184
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,709
 sigma-subadditivity.

185
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,690
 And that is all we need to

186
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,970
 get an outer measure.

187
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,329
 When you see these properties,

188
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:09,040
 you might think this is

189
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:10,779
 indeed a good substitution

190
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,739
 or abstraction for

191
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,559
 measuring normal volumes.

192
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:17,049
 However, you already know

193
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,790
 that this can't work for

194
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:20,450
 the whole power set if you

195
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:22,000
 consider the important Lebesgue

196
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,450
 measure.

197
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,529
 And you also see here in

198
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,519
 part C that we don't have

199
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:28,519
 the equality if we consider

200
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,049
 pairwise disjoint sets

201
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:31,739
 something we usually call

202
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,079
 Sigma additivity.

203
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:35,489
 Hence a natural question

204
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,390
 here is if I start

205
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,010
 with an outer measure, Phi,

206
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,549
 how do I get an ordinary

207
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,529
 measure mu?

208
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,480
 Or in other words, how do

209
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:45,279
 I get also for the map

210
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,179
 Phi the Sigma additivity?

211
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:49,809
 And we already know this

212
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,040
 won't work for the whole

213
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:51,709
 power set.

214
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:53,700
 Therefore, the first thing

215
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:55,000
 we should do is to

216
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,579
 restrict the sets we

217
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,220
 consider.

218
00:05:57,929 --> 00:05:59,549
 And this leads us to our

219
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,670
 next definition,

220
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,220
 we only want to look at some

221
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,019
 good sets that we

222
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,820
 can measure.

223
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:07,059
 And in the end, they will

224
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,500
 form a Sigma algebra again.

225
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:11,260
 And the name for such a

226
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:12,369
 good set

227
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,760
 is phi-

228
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,019
 measurable.

229
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,429
 And we use that name

230
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,260
 if for all other

231
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:20,040
 subsets.

232
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:21,820
 And now I choose to letter

233
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:23,579
 Q for another subset,

234
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:26,390
 we have the following add

235
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,390
 activity rule.

236
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:29,809
 The best thing is again to

237
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,440
 visualize that in a picture.

238
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,160
 So there's a set A and

239
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,000
 here's another set Q.

240
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,019
 Now the set A splits

241
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:39,959
 this set Q into two

242
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,170
 parts, the one

243
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:43,089
 inside A and the

244
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,850
 other one outside

245
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:45,209
 A.

246
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,170
 Or by using formulas, here

247
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:49,720
 we have the inner part and

248
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,130
 here we have the part outside

249
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,910
 A and now we

250
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,600
 measure both sets by

251
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:56,119
 using our map phi

252
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,459
 and add them up.

253
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:00,390
 And now we would say this

254
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,029
 measurement is meaningful

255
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,869
 if we get out the measure

256
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,339
 of Q.

257
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,920
 Again, this

258
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:07,519
 means that we call a set

259
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:08,799
 a phi-

260
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:10,579
 measurable if it's so

261
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:12,140
 good that it divides

262
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:13,920
 every other set Q

263
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:15,739
 into two parts such

264
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,670
 that there our map

265
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:19,559
 phi is indeed additive.

266
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,559
 Obviously, this is the first

267
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,350
 step to the Sigma additivity

268
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:24,920
 we want.

269
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,899
 Now, what I really should

270
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,579
 add here is that in some

271
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:30,059
 books, you might find the

272
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,559
 definition as

273
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:33,100
 greater and equal.

274
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,260
 The reason for that is that

275
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:36,649
 it does not make any difference

276
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,260
 at all because for an outer

277
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:39,579
 measure, you have the other

278
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:41,179
 inequality here in the

279
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,820
 definition.

280
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,290
 Hence, you could define it

281
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:45,549
 in this weaker sense.

282
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,190
 But still, it means the same

283
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,470
 thing.

284
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,899
 Well, let's end this video

285
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,140
 with some cliffhanger.

286
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,350
 But of course, I will go

287
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:53,980
 into more detail in the next

288
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:54,459
 video.

289
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,589
 The important proposition

290
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,290
 here is written in the following

291
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:00,290
 way, if we have an

292
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:01,989
 outer measure on the

293
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,980
 set X,

294
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,640
 then the collection of all

295
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:07,359
 these good sets here.

296
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,160
 And let's call them A

297
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,529
 with index Phi

298
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:13,260
 forms a Sigma

299
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:13,929
 algebra.

300
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,390
 Of course, that makes our

301
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,109
 good sets even better

302
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,970
 because this is the first

303
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,630
 part we need for our measure.

304
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,470
 In fact, if we define a map

305
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,399
 mu on the

306
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,089
 Sigma algebra A phi

307
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,739
 and how can we define it

308
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,739
 very easily?

309
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,030
 We just use our Phi

310
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,820
 from before.

311
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,580
 So we have mu

312
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,229
 of A is the same

313
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:40,099
 thing as putting A into

314
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:41,869
 phi and what

315
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,679
 comes out is a beautiful

316
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,320
 measure.

317
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:46,929
 So you see this is

318
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,450
 indeed a very nice

319
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,109
 result.

320
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:51,169
 And then in the next video,

321
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:53,090
 I will show you some examples

322
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,530
 of outer measures and then

323
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:55,900
 you will see that it's not

324
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:57,489
 hard at all to construct

325
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:57,729
 them.

326
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,309
 In addition, this proposition

327
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,909
 then will help us to get

328
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,750
 out an ordinary measure as

329
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,309
 we want.

330
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,169
 And of course, if you're

331
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,500
 interested, we will also

332
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,799
 prove this proposition.

333
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,179
 OK.

334
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,520
 Thank you for listening and

335
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,500
 see you next time.

336
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,140
 Bye.
