00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back to measure theory.

2
00:00:03,186 --> 00:00:08,229
This is part 2 today and we still have to talk a little bit about sigma algebras.

3
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:12,143
Here you can see the definition from last time.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:22,069
In short maybe a sigma algebra is just a family of subsets of a given set X, which fulfills these 3 rules.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,614
Which means the empty set and the full set is always in the sigma algebra

6
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:32,657
and for each set also the complement is in the sigma algebra

7
00:00:32,943 --> 00:00:39,457
and the third rule says that you can form arbitrarily countable unions inside the sigma algebra.

8
00:00:40,143 --> 00:00:45,986
and all sets that are elements in the sigma algebra are just called measurable sets.

9
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:53,214
Ok, that is good enough for a short recap and now I can tell you, it's easy to show the following.

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,471
Imagine you have a lot of different sigma algebras on a given set X.

11
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:05,686
Let's call them A_i, where i comes from an arbitrary index set.

12
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:09,714
Here it does not matter if the index set is countable or not.

13
00:01:09,914 --> 00:01:15,900
What we can do then is, look at all the intersections of the sigma algebras.

14
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:24,286
This is written in the following way. So this big cap, where we go over the index set and form the intersection.

15
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:33,486
Now, as I said this is easy to show and I advice you to try it, that this indeed gives you again a sigma algebra.

16
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:41,986
So it does not matter if you just look at the intersection of 2 sigma algebras or of the intersection of a lot of sigma algebras

17
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:48,571
You still get the result, that you get a new, smaller sigma algebra from our set X.

18
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:56,529
This result is very helpful if you want to have a lot of properties that your measurable set should have.

19
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:05,914
Then you can just put the properties in different A_i's and then just form an *INTERSECTION* to get out a sigma algebra,

20
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,229
where all your measurable sets, have all the properties.

21
00:02:09,886 --> 00:02:17,057
In short this result helps you a lot, if you want to define a suitable sigma algebra for your problem

22
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:25,771
and this gives rise to the next definition. For this let's fix a family of subsets.

23
00:02:25,871 --> 00:02:30,579
So we have a subset of the power set of the given set.

24
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:38,257
In other words just the collection of some subsets, which means they don't have to form a sigma algebra yet.

25
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:44,757
However the result is now that we can form a sigma algebra out of this M

26
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:54,314
and we can choose the smallest sigma algebra and smallest just means with respect to the set inclusion, that contains this set M.

27
00:02:54,486 --> 00:02:59,614
The interesting thing is that we immediately know how to form such a small sigma algebra.

28
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:02,971
Yeah, we just look at the intersection again.

29
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:12,843
There we just put in sigma algebras A, where we know that our sigma algebra has to be bigger than our set M.

30
00:03:13,429 --> 00:03:21,271
Still, keep in mind that we are working inside the power set. So we are working with sets of subsets.

31
00:03:21,357 --> 00:03:27,157
That could be confusing, but it does not matter in our whole set construction here.

32
00:03:27,514 --> 00:03:31,557
Yeah and keep in mind that our A has to be sigma algebras.

33
00:03:34,986 --> 00:03:42,719
So we are putting in sigma algebras and use intersections so we know that something comes out and it is still a sigma algebra

34
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:50,743
and because it's an intersection of the smallest sigma algebra with this property. So the smallest one that contains M.

35
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,343
However you see this is a long term to write down.

36
00:03:54,486 --> 00:04:04,743
Therefore the common notation one uses is just a sigma of this set M as the definition of this intersection.

37
00:04:05,414 --> 00:04:12,557
Another name for this sigma algebra is often the sigma algebra that is generated by M.

38
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:20,657
Keep in mind, it's no problem to find a sigma algebra that contains M. You can just use the power set if you want.

39
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:26,529
The real question is therefore to find the most efficient sigma algebra.

40
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,200
So where you have to add the least amount of sets to get to a sigma algebra

41
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,557
and this is indeed the sigma M.

42
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:39,614
To get used to this definition, let's look at an easy example.

43
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:47,214
Let's look at a set with 4 elements. So let's call them a, b, c and d

44
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:55,386
and then we define a set of subsets. So maybe I just choose singletons.

45
00:04:55,387 --> 00:05:01,486
So this is just the subset that contains only a and this is just a subset that contains only b

46
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,071
and I form the whole set. So this is my family of subsets.

47
00:05:06,914 --> 00:05:10,329
First thing to note, this is not a sigma algebra yet.

48
00:05:10,414 --> 00:05:19,214
So we can form now our sigma(M). Which should be the smallest sigma algebra that contains this family of subsets.

49
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:23,943
We immediately know 2 things. First of all we know that it's a sigma algebra.

50
00:05:23,986 --> 00:05:29,357
So we know it contains the empty set and the whole set X.

51
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,314
This is the first property of the sigma algebra.

52
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,100
The next thing we know is that it's the sigma algebra that contains our set M.

53
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:48,471
So therefore also "a" as a set and b as a set, has to be inside sigma(M).

54
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:51,914
Now, if you thing about the other properties of the sigma algebra, 

55
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:59,157
we remember, that we know that all the countable unions are inside the sigma algebra.

56
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:08,557
Countable unions is of course, union of these two sets. So we know that also {a,b} has to be inside the sigma algebra.

57
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:18,114
All other unions we can form with these 4 sets don't change anything. We still get out our X, the empty set or {a} or {b}.

58
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:22,729
So these are all the unions we can form out of these 4 sets.

59
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:30,771
Then let's go to the one remaining property of a sigma algebra, namely that all the complements are also inside the sigma algebra.

60
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,986
Which means here, the complement of {a} is of course {b,c,d}.

61
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:44,414
There is also b inside the sigma algebra and the complement of b is of course {a,c,d}

62
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:51,629
and then we also have to add the complement of {a,b}, which is {c,d}.

63
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:58,229
Every step with did up to this point, were things we needed to do to reach a sigma algebra.

64
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:02,300
So there was no other choice then adding all these elements here.

65
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:08,771
The question still remains. Was this sufficient? So did we get to a sigma algebra yet?

66
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:16,671
This is what we can now immediately check. So for example the first rule is fulfilled. Empty set are inside.

67
00:07:16,743 --> 00:07:23,214
All complements are inside. So if we look at complements here and here, we still see that all are there.

68
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:31,443
Ok, then what about the unions? So we know the unions here and here fit together, but what about the unions here?

69
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:37,557
So just check all possible unions and then you see, all the sets are there,

70
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:43,186
we need to be stable under the operations of union and complements.

71
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:47,700
So this means, what we have here is indeed a sigma algebra.

72
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,248
and by construction it was the smallest one possible to get from M to sigma algebra.

73
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:57,843
So this is indeed sigma(M).

74
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:06,786
So what you saw here was that it's not so hard to get to the sigma algebra, if we start with a finite set.

75
00:08:06,857 --> 00:08:14,986
So if you have finitely many elements, we can do all the finitely many operations to end at our sigma algebra.

76
00:08:15,714 --> 00:08:20,500
Obviously this has to be much harder if we start with an infinite set,

77
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:26,414
because then we have to do infinitely many steps until we reach the sigma algebra

78
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:34,143
and this leads us now to the most important sigma algebra and I will define it here.

79
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:40,100
This works if our set X is a topological space.

80
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:48,357
If you don't know what a topological space is, you can work in the same way if your X is a metric space.

81
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:57,086
If you also don't know what a metric space is, then you can choose X more concretely as R or R^n if you want.

82
00:08:57,229 --> 00:09:04,400
These things work all the same, because the only ingredient we need here is to know what open sets are.

83
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:12,357
Now you might already know what we want to do. We want to have all these open sets in our sigma algebra.

84
00:09:13,071 --> 00:09:22,871
Which means we will look at a sigma algebra that the open sets generate and indeed, this is the Borel sigma algebra.

85
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:25,629
Denoted by B(X).

86
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:32,280
This is the sigma algebra generated by the open sets.

87
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,043
If you are working in a topological space, normally you would say, 

88
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:44,243
Ok, I have my set X together with a topology. So this could be my T and call this a topological space

89
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,057
and the topology are just the open sets.

90
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:57,529
Which means by our definition from above, our Borel sigma algebra is nothing more than sigma of this topology.

91
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:06,200
And this is the Borel sigma algebra. Maybe to be more concrete, it's the Borel sigma algebra on X.

92
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:11,586
What you should note is that in our notation, the topology vanishes.

93
00:10:11,643 --> 00:10:20,009
So there is no mention of this topology inside B(X), because most of the time the topology is clear.

94
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:24,686
It's also obvious which topology or metric we use.

95
00:10:25,043 --> 00:10:32,429
For example, in R^n we use our standard topology, so we know what the open sets in R^n are

96
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:37,957
and therefore we immediately know what the Borel sigma algebra of R^n is.

97
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,157
Therefore you really should keep in mind that by definition of the Borel sigma algebra,

98
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:50,471
it includes the topological structure, so what open means, into a sigma algebra

99
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:57,149
and in the case of R^n, this is indeed a really big sigma algebra, but not a power set.

100
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:04,500
So it's not the biggest possible sigma algebra, but it's the most suitable sigma algebra in our context,

101
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:11,429
because it contains all the sets we want to measure and this is what we will do in the next video,

102
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:14,500
where I want to define what a measure is

103
00:11:14,714 --> 00:11:24,286
and there you will see that in the case of R^n, we need this Borel sigma algebra and can't choose the power set,

104
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:28,286
because our measure should fulfill some meaningfull rules.

105
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:34,714
And these rules can't be fulfilled on the whole power set, but on the Borel sigma algebra

106
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:39,443
and the Borel sigma algebra is big enough. There are a lot of sets inside.

107
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,714
Indeed all the sets are inside, we want to measure in the end.

108
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:46,957
Then thank you very much and see you next time.
