1
00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:02,490
 Hello and welcome

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,119
 back.

3
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,050
 And as always, I thank

4
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:06,690
 all the nice people that

5
00:00:06,699 --> 00:00:08,310
 support this channel on

6
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:10,170
 Steady today,

7
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,649
 we consider part

8
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:13,390
 11 in our measure

9
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:14,649
 theory series.

10
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:17,149
 And as promised, it will

11
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:18,889
 be about the proof

12
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,750
 of Lebesgue's dominated

13
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,110
 convergence theorem.

14
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:24,940
 I already told you this is

15
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,899
 one of my favourite theorems.

16
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:28,299
 And you will see that the

17
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:29,860
 proof is indeed not so

18
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,459
 hard.

19
00:00:31,069 --> 00:00:31,329
 OK.

20
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,709
 Then let's recall the

21
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,580
 theorem from the last part

22
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,580
 of the series.

23
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:38,279
 Here you see all the

24
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,919
 assumptions we need for

25
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:41,470
 Lebesgue's dominated convergence

26
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,029
 theorem.

27
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,959
 On the one hand, we have

28
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,849
 a sequence of measurable

29
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,619
 maps and

30
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,150
 also the pointwise limit

31
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,639
 function which we will call

32
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,729
 just F.

33
00:00:52,529 --> 00:00:53,950
 And on the other hand, we

34
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:55,909
 have another function G

35
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:57,669
 which is integrable.

36
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:00,430
 And this function G is

37
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,909
 indeed the

38
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:03,619
 important ingredient in the

39
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,510
 whole theorem.

40
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,309
 It should lie

41
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,900
 above all the

42
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,029
 functions FN.

43
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,589
 And therefore we call it

44
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,430
 an integrable majorant.

45
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,500
 From these nice

46
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,339
 assumptions.

47
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,160
 We now can conclude

48
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,080
 that all the functions in

49
00:01:19,089 --> 00:01:20,800
 the sequence are also

50
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,750
 integrable.

51
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,580
 And moreover, also the

52
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:26,419
 mu almost everywhere point-

53
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,290
 wise limit function F is

54
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,510
 also integrable.

55
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:31,760
 From this, we can conclude

56
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:33,279
 that all these integrals

57
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,360
 here make sense.

58
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:37,069
 And the equality tells us

59
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,660
 that we can pull in the

60
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:40,389
 limit into the integral.

61
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,459
 And that's the reason we

62
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,449
 call it a convergence theorem.

63
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,489
 Well, then let's start

64
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,339
 with the proof

65
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:51,019
 the ingredients we need for

66
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:52,559
 the proof are on the one

67
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:54,519
 side properties of the integral.

68
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:56,519
 And also on the other hand,

69
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,279
 Fatou's lemma

70
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,760
 from the properties of the

71
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:01,550
 interval, we can immediately

72
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:03,430
 show the first property here.

73
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,190
 Please recall that lying

74
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,020
 in L1 means that the

75
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:09,820
 absolute value of

76
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,559
 FN has a finite

77
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,300
 integral.

78
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,779
 Please remember we have

79
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:16,660
 measurable maps and this

80
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,369
 is a non-negative function.

81
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,160
 Therefore, the integral always

82
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:20,850
 exists.

83
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,139
 But in the worst case, it

84
00:02:22,149 --> 00:02:23,399
 could be infinity.

85
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,020
 Therefore lying in L1

86
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:27,440
 means this is not

87
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:28,220
 infinity.

88
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:29,759
 So smaller than

89
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,419
 infinity.

90
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:31,759
 OK.

91
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,550
 Now we can use our assumption

92
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:35,240
 we know that we have an integrable

93
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,820
 majorant

94
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:38,779
 called g.

95
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,789
 So we have an inequality

96
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,309
 here.

97
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,210
 And you remember we have

98
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,050
 a monotonicity property of

99
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:46,820
 the integral.

100
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,550
 This means we also have the

101
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:51,240
 inequality in the

102
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,559
 integral sense.

103
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,910
 So let's put that to the

104
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,440
 left.

105
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:57,190
 And then I know this is less

106
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,720
 or equal than the

107
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:00,350
 integral of G.

108
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:04,059
 Now note that this right

109
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,520
 hand side is indeed our

110
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:07,320
 assumption that the integral

111
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,759
 of G is indeed

112
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,600
 finite.

113
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:12,690
 Our conclusion is now this

114
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:14,199
 integral is also

115
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:14,990
 finite.

116
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:17,550
 And this means all the

117
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:19,330
 FN lie in

118
00:03:19,339 --> 00:03:19,729
 L one.

119
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:22,589
 Obviously we can do the

120
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,389
 same for F

121
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,850
 instead of FN

122
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:27,380
 because we know it's a point

123
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:28,979
 where it's limited almost

124
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,740
 everywhere.

125
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,440
 Therefore, this inequality

126
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:33,850
 holds almost

127
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,720
 everywhere.

128
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:37,720
 And of course, also almost

129
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:39,419
 everywhere, the monotonicity

130
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:41,320
 property still holds, which

131
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,889
 means we get the same

132
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:44,779
 inequality here for the integral

133
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:45,259
 of F.

134
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:48,000
 In other words, we also

135
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:49,669
 have F in L

136
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:50,149
 one.

137
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,619
 OK.

138
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,410
 Very good.

139
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:53,940
 So what you have seen now

140
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:55,610
 is that the first part in

141
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:57,449
 the theorem was very easy to

142
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:57,919
 show.

143
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,490
 Hence, the crucial thing

144
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,699
 in the theorem is

145
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,100
 indeed this

146
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,699
 convergence statement here.

147
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,490
 OK.

148
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,929
 So this is what we do in

149
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,449
 the next five minutes.

150
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,779
 And indeed, I want to show

151
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:12,690
 something a little bit

152
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,050
 more stronger.

153
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,250
 We will show that the

154
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,928
 integral of the absolute

155
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,230
 value of

156
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:21,010
 FN minus the

157
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,720
 pointwise limit F

158
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,299
 goes to zero

159
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,959
 if N goes to

160
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:26,750
 infinity.

161
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:30,350
 And from this, we can immediately

162
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:32,149
 conclude the property we

163
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,709
 want here.

164
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:35,679
 However, let us start

165
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,519
 showing this property here.

166
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:39,350
 OK.

167
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,760
 In the integral, we have

168
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:42,290
 the function FN

169
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:43,649
 minus F.

170
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,309
 But in the absolute

171
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,140
 value now we

172
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:49,040
 know that for the absolute

173
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:50,929
 volume going a detour

174
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,779
 makes it greater or in the

175
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,299
 best case, it stays the same

176
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,709
 now going the detour to

177
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,269
 0.

178
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,640
 This means we have the absolute

179
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:00,549
 value of FN plus

180
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:01,989
 the absolute value of

181
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,589
 F.

182
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:04,980
 This is just the

183
00:05:04,989 --> 00:05:06,809
 triangle inequality for the

184
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,829
 absolute value.

185
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,279
 When we read it point-

186
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,130
 wisely, this means

187
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,829
 we could put in x's

188
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,350
 here for the functions,

189
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,640
 but it holds for all the

190
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,029
 x's.

191
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,489
 Therefore, this is just the

192
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,880
 short notation we use

193
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,220
 also what we know is that

194
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,869
 we have our majorant

195
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,660
 G for FN.

196
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,609
 And also for F, as I told

197
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,470
 you, therefore,

198
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,339
 we have this as less

199
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,019
 or equal than

200
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:33,950
 two G,

201
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,010
 one G plus one G.

202
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,750
 Now you could say this

203
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,250
 inequality only

204
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,179
 holds mu almost

205
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,899
 everywhere.

206
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,049
 However, it does not matter

207
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:46,779
 at all because the integral

208
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,600
 does not see changes that

209
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:50,059
 happen almost

210
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:51,540
 nowhere,

211
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:53,820
 which is the complement of

212
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:54,940
 almost everywhere.

213
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,040
 Therefore, we could change

214
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:58,510
 or choose another function

215
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,820
 G where this

216
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:01,579
 inequality here does

217
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:03,269
 indeed hold everywhere.

218
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:05,660
 Hence, we can assume that

219
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,739
 we do this here.

220
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,720
 And therefore, I can omit

221
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,100
 the mu almost everywhere

222
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,369
 and it makes the proof just

223
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:11,899
 shorter.

224
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,500
 OK.

225
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,220
 Now I can bring this on the

226
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,769
 other side and I get

227
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:18,429
 out a non negative

228
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,929
 function I want to call

229
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:21,049
 h_n.

230
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,049
 So this would be two G

231
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,359
 minus our absolute

232
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:27,149
 value FN minus

233
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,000
 F.

234
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,489
 And we know it's non-

235
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,269
 negative.

236
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,309
 Obviously, this holds for

237
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,209
 all N and we know

238
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,130
 by the properties of

239
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,019
 measurable functions that

240
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:40,809
 h_n is

241
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,320
 also measurable.

242
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,779
 Now, I have written that

243
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,739
 down in such a way that you

244
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,890
 should recognize

245
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:49,410
 immediately Fatou's

246
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,089
 Lemma simply

247
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,420
 because we have

248
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:54,160
 measurable functions

249
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:56,250
 and they are all non-

250
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,079
 negative.

251
00:06:58,299 --> 00:06:59,920
 Therefore, now we can

252
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:01,630
 apply Fatou's Lemma.

253
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,200
 Fatou's Lemma tells us something

254
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:06,799
 about the limit

255
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:07,779
 inferior.

256
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:08,910
 So liminf.

257
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,910
 namely, it tells us that

258
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,519
 we can look at the integral

259
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:16,269
 of the liminf and we can

260
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,209
 pull it out with an

261
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,589
 inequality sign.

262
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:22,220
 In fact, it's possible that

263
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,179
 it gets bigger if we

264
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,500
 pull the liminf

265
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,420
 outside.

266
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,510
 However, the inequality

267
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,820
 always holds and that is

268
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:32,029
 what we can need here.

269
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,149
 Of course, you should ask

270
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,660
 yourself, do we

271
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,630
 know the liminf here?

272
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,329
 And here,

273
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:42,079
 maybe we should look first

274
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:43,380
 on the left hand side

275
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:46,179
 inside the integral, it

276
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,869
 always means the point

277
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,769
 wise limit.

278
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:51,119
 Now it's the pointwise Liminf

279
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,450
 .

280
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,519
 But we know that the point

281
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:54,869
 wise limit of

282
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,329
 HN indeed

283
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:57,130
 exists

284
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,619
 and therefore, it should

285
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,130
 be the same as the limits.

286
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:02,839
 OK.

287
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,290
 So let's write it down.

288
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,519
 We know this is the integral

289
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,250
 of our point wise limit of

290
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,200
 HN two G

291
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:11,029
 is two G.

292
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,899
 But we know F is the point

293
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:14,679
 limit of FN and

294
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,600
 therefore this one is

295
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:17,140
 zero.

296
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:18,679
 So only two G

297
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,600
 remains here.

298
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:21,619
 OK.

299
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,890
 Then let's look at the right

300
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:24,179
 hand side there.

301
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,980
 We have the integral of HN.

302
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,630
 However, the integral is

303
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,279
 linear.

304
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,799
 So we have indeed two

305
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:32,609
 integrals, one of two G

306
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:33,979
 and the other one of our

307
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:35,390
 F and minus F in the absolute

308
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:35,890
 value.

309
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,400
 For the first part, the liminf

310
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:39,630
 does not matter.

311
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,840
 So we can write down

312
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:42,820
 immediately we have

313
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,159
 two G here.

314
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,210
 Then for the second part,

315
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:49,039
 you have to be careful, we

316
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:50,640
 subtract something positive.

317
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:51,840
 And we look at the liminf

318
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,080
 which means to get

319
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,000
 out the liminf we have to

320
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,909
 subtract the limsup, the

321
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,000
 limit superior

322
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,200
 or maybe in other words,

323
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,909
 if you want to find the

324
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,739
 smallest outcome here

325
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,539
 as a non negative

326
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:07,950
 number, yeah, you have to

327
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,989
 subtract here.

328
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:11,150
 The biggest possible number.

329
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,599
 OK.

330
00:09:12,609 --> 00:09:13,919
 So this explains why we have

331
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,739
 to limsup here, but we

332
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,890
 don't change the integral

333
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,289
 at all.

334
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:18,909
 So this is FN

335
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,729
 minus F dmu

336
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:22,719
 OK?

337
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,640
 We have the left hand side

338
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,880
 here and the right hand side

339
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,599
 here, we have a very nice

340
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:27,919
 inequality

341
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,159
 if I then add what I

342
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:32,349
 missed before here.

343
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,979
 So the d mu and our

344
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:35,969
 X then you will recognize

345
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:37,400
 immediately that we have the

346
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:38,549
 same on the left and the

347
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,270
 right here.

348
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,690
 Of course, now you

349
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,619
 should subtract the same

350
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,219
 thing on both sides.

351
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:51,530
 If we do this, we find

352
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:52,809
 zero on the left

353
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,640
 obviously

354
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,320
 and only this part here

355
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,469
 on the right hand side.

356
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:59,250
 So minus our

357
00:09:59,260 --> 00:09:59,869
 limsup

358
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:01,849
 OK.

359
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:03,429
 So the minus sign is not

360
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,349
 so beautiful.

361
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:05,440
 Therefore, I want to bring

362
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,789
 this on the other side,

363
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,130
 which means we now

364
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,070
 have the inequality here

365
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,770
 on the right, which means

366
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,200
 this would be without the

367
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,080
 minus sign less or

368
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,169
 equal than zero.

369
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,150
 OK.

370
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,140
 So now please note this is

371
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,409
 very interesting.

372
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,390
 The limsup of non-

373
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:25,940
 negative numbers

374
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:27,250
 should be non-

375
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,109
 positives.

376
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:30,840
 Hence, from this, we

377
00:10:30,849 --> 00:10:32,739
 can conclude that the

378
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,080
 limit exists.

379
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:36,599
 We do this in the following

380
00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:38,520
 way, we say OK, I

381
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:38,880
 have to limsup

382
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,580
 here, so this is always

383
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,520
 greater or equal than

384
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,260
 the liminf

385
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,099
 Of course, this holds for

386
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:47,659
 all sequence of

387
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:48,460
 numbers.

388
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,059
 The liminf is always less

389
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,719
 or equal than the limsup.

390
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,530
 But still we have non-

391
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:57,039
 negative numbers here.

392
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:58,760
 Therefore, the liminf should

393
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,739
 be also nonnegative.

394
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:02,770
 So we have this inequality

395
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,179
 here.

396
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:05,559
 This one here is now always

397
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,200
 nice.

398
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,169
 We have inequalities but

399
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:09,869
 on the left is the

400
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,690
 same as on the right.

401
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:14,309
 This simply means that

402
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,119
 all the inequalities here

403
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,219
 are in fact

404
00:11:17,229 --> 00:11:18,140
 equalities.

405
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,169
 There is simply no other

406
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,799
 way, which means the liminf

407
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:23,710
 is equal to the limsup,

408
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:25,250
 which means the limit

409
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,229
 exists and is equal to

410
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:29,190
 the limsup and liminf which

411
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,909
 is zero.

412
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,659
 So let's write it down limit

413
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:34,549
 exists and the limit

414
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,659
 of this integral

415
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,520
 is equal to

416
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,200
 zero.

417
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:44,359
 Well, this is what we wanted

418
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,210
 to show and I explained

419
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:47,880
 before this is a stronger

420
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,409
 result than that what we

421
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:51,080
 have in Lebesgue's

422
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:51,679
 theorem.

423
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:54,020
 But I will now show you how

424
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,869
 we get to the result

425
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,820
 in Lebesgue's dominated convergence

426
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,239
 theorem.

427
00:11:58,979 --> 00:11:59,289
 OK.

428
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:00,630
 Let's do that now.

429
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,099
 So we want to

430
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:04,940
 show that

431
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,049
 the limit of the

432
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:07,979
 functions

433
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,760
 and the integral is

434
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,690
 equal to the

435
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,080
 integral of our

436
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:14,700
 function.

437
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,349
 F

438
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:17,710
 therefore, we can look at

439
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:19,200
 the difference and in the

440
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,080
 absolute value and show

441
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,640
 that this goes to

442
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,140
 zero for N to

443
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,880
 infinity.

444
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,200
 OK.

445
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,369
 The first part we can note

446
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,020
 is this is also

447
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,719
 nonnegative because it's

448
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:31,719
 an absolute value.

449
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:34,059
 And then the next steps we

450
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,690
 can use the properties we

451
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,450
 already know from the integral,

452
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:38,979
 for example, the

453
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:39,890
 linearity.

454
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,130
 So we know this is indeed

455
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,080
 just one integral where we

456
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,530
 have F and

457
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:46,349
 minus F in

458
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:47,619
 the integral

459
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,840
 itself.

460
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,570
 And the absolute value around.

461
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,690
 Now, in the next part, we

462
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,109
 use something that is also

463
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:56,270
 called triangle

464
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,409
 inequality.

465
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,580
 But here now for

466
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,719
 integrals, which means now

467
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,909
 put the absolute value inside

468
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,340
 and then we can get bigger

469
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:06,340
 or stay the same.

470
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,059
 Here, we now reach something

471
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,750
 that we already know at

472
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,780
 least in a limit.

473
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,590
 So it goes to

474
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:16,549
 for N

475
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:17,789
 to infinity.

476
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,859
 Hence the last step we need

477
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:22,419
 here now is just a

478
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:24,289
 small sandwich theorem.

479
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,400
 Now, on the limit we have

480
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:27,950
 the zero left and

481
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,440
 right.

482
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,090
 And therefore we know this

483
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:31,969
 limit also exists

484
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:33,609
 and is equal to zero.

485
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,359
 And therefore the whole thing

486
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:37,840
 in the absolute value has

487
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:39,409
 a limit and is equal to

488
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:39,940
 zero.

489
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,409
 So putting that on the other

490
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:43,369
 side, we now can conclude

491
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:46,059
 limit of the integrals of

492
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,289
 FN is

493
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:48,650
 equal to the

494
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:50,559
 integral of F.

495
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,330
 And here you see this is

496
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,770
 the convergence statement

497
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,520
 that we wanted to prove in

498
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,280
 the beginning.

499
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,270
 And that was the proof of

500
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,630
 Lebesgue's dominated

501
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,849
 convergence theorem.

502
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,460
 I already told you

503
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:09,440
 this part dominated

504
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,340
 is the important ingredient

505
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:13,239
 for the theorem because

506
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,159
 we need such an

507
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:17,239
 integrable majorant

508
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,030
 we call this majorant just

509
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,539
 G but you saw

510
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,549
 we need this and

511
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,510
 then we can apply

512
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,630
 Lebesgue's dominated convergence

513
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,099
 theorem.

514
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:31,109
 If you want to see some

515
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:32,739
 applications of

516
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,619
 this theorem, please let

517
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,590
 me know because this

518
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:37,950
 could be a very good idea

519
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,450
 for the next part in the

520
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,150
 series.

521
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,479
 So thank you very much and

522
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:43,719
 see you next time.

523
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,679
 Bye.
