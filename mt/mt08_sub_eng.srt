00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,529
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,539 --> 00:00:03,970
 the next video in this

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:04,769
 series.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,269
 I thank all the nice people

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,689
 that support this channel

6
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:09,630
 on Steady

7
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,470
 Well, this is measure theory

8
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:13,779
 part eight.

9
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,359
 And we are still talking

10
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:17,049
 about the monotone convergence

11
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:17,670
 theorem.

12
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,590
 But today I want to show

13
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,329
 you mainly the proof

14
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,840
 of this theorem

15
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,600
 for the start of this video.

16
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:27,540
 It might be helpful to

17
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:29,350
 give you a recap what the

18
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,899
 monotone convergence theorem

19
00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:32,729
 states. For the

20
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,479
 ingredients, we need a measure

21
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,939
 space and

22
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,380
 measurable maps

23
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:39,549
 as always they are non-

24
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,200
 negative.

25
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:41,880
 And we have a whole sequence

26
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:43,520
 of such measurable maps.

27
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,720
 And in addition, we also

28
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:47,169
 have the limit where we call

29
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,720
 this just F without an

30
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:49,279
 index.

31
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:50,389
 OK.

32
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,119
 Because the theorem is called

33
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,869
 monotone convergence theorem.

34
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,669
 We need two things first,

35
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,349
 a monotonic property and

36
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,869
 also a convergent property.

37
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,340
 The first thing is therefore

38
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:02,509
 the sequence is

39
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,379
 monotonically increasing

40
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,049
 but only almost everywhere

41
00:01:07,058 --> 00:01:08,579
 with respect to our measure

42
00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:08,869
 mu

43
00:01:09,558 --> 00:01:11,049
 And the second property I

44
00:01:11,058 --> 00:01:12,888
 already told you F should

45
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:14,329
 be the limit of

46
00:01:14,338 --> 00:01:16,308
 FN and the limit should

47
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,219
 be in the pointwise sense which

48
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:19,719
 means I fix a point

49
00:01:19,728 --> 00:01:21,369
 X and then I have a normal

50
00:01:21,378 --> 00:01:23,109
 limit of real numbers.

51
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:25,088
 However, as before, this

52
00:01:25,098 --> 00:01:26,738
 property only has to hold

53
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:28,088
 almost everywhere.

54
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,639
 So much about the premise.

55
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,400
 Now let's talk about the

56
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,169
 conclusion.

57
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,610
 The theorem tells us that

58
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,069
 we can push the

59
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,790
 limit into the

60
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,599
 integral.

61
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,410
 This means that the sequence

62
00:01:41,419 --> 00:01:43,150
 of integrals converges

63
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,150
 to an integral where in the

64
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,779
 integral there's the

65
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,650
 limit of the sequence.

66
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,989
 And of course, this is just

67
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,050
 our F here.

68
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,550
 And now we have again our

69
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:59,050
 monotone convergence

70
00:01:59,059 --> 00:01:59,569
 theorem.

71
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,050
 However, I should tell you

72
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:04,050
 there is an alternative formulation

73
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:05,750
 of this theorem which is

74
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,250
 a little bit more general

75
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,679
 what you do there is you

76
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,750
 include also

77
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:12,619
 functions that have the

78
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,479
 symbol infinity as an

79
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,160
 outcome.

80
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,580
 Of course, then you have

81
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:19,270
 to extend the Borel Sigma

82
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:20,860
 algebra to this

83
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:22,380
 new bigger set

84
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,229
 and also extend the notion

85
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,199
 of measurable.

86
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,809
 And indeed, that's not a

87
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,740
 problem at all

88
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,000
 in the same way.

89
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:31,509
 Also the definition of the

90
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,740
 Integral does not change

91
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,309
 at all because in the worst

92
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,919
 case, as always, it could

93
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:36,839
 be infinity.

94
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,279
 The advantage of this formulation

95
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:40,990
 is now that you can get rid

96
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,470
 of the F completely.

97
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,009
 So we don't need this

98
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,660
 and we don't need

99
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:47,470
 this

100
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,179
 simply because everything

101
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:52,009
 follows from the monotonic

102
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,800
 property here, we have

103
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:55,619
 measurable functions and

104
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,130
 we know the supremum is also

105
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:58,949
 measurable and they are

106
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,619
 monotonically increasing.

107
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:02,419
 So we know the supremum is given

108
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:03,789
 almost everywhere as the

109
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,259
 limit.

110
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,369
 And there you see this is

111
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,369
 just a more compact formulation

112
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,470
 of the theorem.

113
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,320
 And as I told you before,

114
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,380
 in the worst case, you have

115
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:13,979
 infinity left and

116
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,729
 right in the conclusion here.

117
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,419
 Well, so this was the

118
00:03:19,429 --> 00:03:20,300
 introduction.

119
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:22,229
 Now, let's look at

120
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,000
 the proof,

121
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:27,220
 of course, we use what we

122
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:28,199
 know we have a

123
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,389
 monotonically

124
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:31,309
 increasing sequence

125
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,389
 of functions.

126
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,009
 This property holds almost

127
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,759
 everywhere.

128
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,330
 And if you remember what

129
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:39,710
 we did in the last video,

130
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,039
 we know that we have the

131
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,880
 monotonicity property of

132
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:43,970
 the Lebesgue integral.

133
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,089
 This means that the integral

134
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,669
 conserves

135
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:49,429
 these inequalities.

136
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,320
 Now we have a monotonically

137
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,210
 increasing sequence of real

138
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,600
 numbers where also

139
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,059
 infinity can occur

140
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,440
 in the same sense, we can

141
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,250
 write down the inequality

142
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:04,270
 for all N.

143
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:05,929
 So we know that the limit

144
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,009
 is always bigger or equal

145
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,850
 than FN for

146
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,639
 all N and almost

147
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:12,429
 everywhere,

148
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:14,800
 simply because the limit

149
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:16,279
 is almost everywhere, the

150
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,200
 supremum and because

151
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,920
 this holds almost everywhere,

152
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:21,829
 we know it holds for the

153
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,309
 integral as well.

154
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:26,179
 And there you see, we already

155
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,690
 have one part of the

156
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,720
 equality here.

157
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,649
 We want to show.

158
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:31,489
 So let's call this star

159
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,850
 for a reference

160
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:35,630
 and let's show the one

161
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,380
 inequality.

162
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,970
 So we formed the limit on

163
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,309
 both sides here.

164
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:41,070
 Of course, we don't change

165
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,160
 the inequality here.

166
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,609
 And we have no limit on the

167
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:44,809
 right hand side because there's

168
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,429
 no N involved.

169
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,170
 And therefore we have this

170
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:49,329
 as the inequality.

171
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:51,510
 And this is exactly one

172
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,420
 part of our

173
00:04:53,429 --> 00:04:54,739
 equality star.

174
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,269
 Do you see this was not so

175
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:57,790
 hard.

176
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,579
 This part comes immediately

177
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,959
 but for the other part we

178
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,410
 need to use the definition

179
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,640
 of the Lebesgue integral.

180
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,839
 And this always means that

181
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,790
 we go back to step or simple

182
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:09,709
 functions.

183
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:11,480
 Therefore, let h be an

184
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:13,390
 arbitrary chosen simple function

185
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,130
 that lies below

186
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,559
 our function F

187
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:20,239
 and also choose a

188
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,709
 fixed error

189
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,589
 epsilon

190
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:24,559
 at this point.

191
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,049
 I think a short sketch is

192
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,730
 very helpful to get the idea.

193
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,720
 Here is our function F

194
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,779
 and this one should be the

195
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,630
 step function H so maybe

196
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,559
 it looks like this.

197
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,299
 OK.

198
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:40,220
 So this would be the usual

199
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,799
 idea.

200
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,609
 Now we know we have the pointwise

201
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:45,160
 convergence of this

202
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,500
 sequence of functions to

203
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,160
 F.

204
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,850
 So maybe we can choose some

205
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:50,179
 FN that lies

206
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52,600
 very close to F.

207
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:54,359
 So maybe this is

208
00:05:54,369 --> 00:05:56,029
 our chosen FN.

209
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:59,040
 The idea of the epsilon is

210
00:05:59,049 --> 00:06:00,929
 now that we can always push

211
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,709
 down the step function by

212
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,640
 this epsilon.

213
00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:05,390
 So this would be epsilon

214
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,619
 and then the new step function

215
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,549
 looks like this.

216
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,859
 And this should then always

217
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,760
 be a step function that lies

218
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:13,000
 below FN.

219
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,859
 Hence I define now

220
00:06:15,869 --> 00:06:17,739
 sets XN

221
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:19,660
 where I put in all the

222
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,109
 points X

223
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,089
 where FN of X

224
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,549
 is bigger than the

225
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:27,260
 shifted step function.

226
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:28,609
 And the shifted step function

227
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:30,190
 is just one minus

228
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,029
 epsilon h

229
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,299
 because we have our

230
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:36,700
 convergence of the

231
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:38,670
 sequence FN to F

232
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:39,899
 almost everywhere

233
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,859
 we know that

234
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:43,899
 almost every X

235
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,730
 in X lies

236
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,410
 in at least one of these

237
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:47,929
 XN.

238
00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:50,480
 In other words, we can look

239
00:06:50,489 --> 00:06:52,399
 at the union of all these

240
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,369
 XN and

241
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,369
 let's call it X tilde,

242
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,450
 then we know that the complement

243
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,450
 of X tilde is a set with

244
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:01,489
 measure zero.

245
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,950
 Knowing this, we can now

246
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,429
 look at the integral again.

247
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:10,010
 Now we start here with the

248
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:11,089
 left hand side.

249
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,670
 So I want to look at the

250
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:14,529
 integral of FN.

251
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:17,890
 This integral gets not

252
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:19,850
 bigger if I change the set

253
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:20,850
 to a smaller set.

254
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:22,160
 So here I want to choose

255
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,010
 XN

256
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,700
 Fn dmu.

257
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,329
 Now inside the set XN,

258
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:30,239
 we have this inequality

259
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:31,570
 and can use the normal

260
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:33,390
 monotonicity of the integral.

261
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,250
 Therefore, I have the same

262
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,500
 inequality here.

263
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,109
 And a new function inside

264
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:39,480
 the integral which is now

265
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:40,959
 one minus epsilon

266
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,480
  h dmu.

267
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,070
 And of course, we want to

268
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,209
 look at the limit.

269
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:48,089
 So we found the limit here

270
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,250
 on both sides,

271
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,859
 then we get

272
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,420
 limit

273
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,829
 of the integrals.

274
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,250
 And on the right hand side,

275
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,089
 we have the limit of

276
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,329
 these integrals.

277
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:01,769
 OK.

278
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,720
 At this point, I want to

279
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,529
 omit some details because

280
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,869
 otherwise we will lose our

281
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,989
 focus completely.

282
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,010
 What one can show now is

283
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:11,890
 that this is indeed

284
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,869
 the integral over

285
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,720
 X tilde.

286
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,170
 And we don't change the

287
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:18,320
 function at all.

288
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:20,690
 And what we need in the details

289
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,239
 is of course that this is

290
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,109
 a step function.

291
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,820
 So the integral is very easy.

292
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,510
 Essentially, it's just a

293
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,880
 sum of our measures.

294
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:30,420
 And we know that the

295
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:31,799
 sets here are

296
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:33,760
 increasing, you

297
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,619
 have to find the sets appropriately.

298
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,830
 But then you get out that

299
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,260
 you have a monotonically

300
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,229
 increasing sequence

301
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:41,020
 of sets.

302
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:42,450
 OK.

303
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,700
 In summary, I'll leave the

304
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,969
 details here for you.

305
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:46,950
 But remember we can do

306
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,580
 this because this is just

307
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,010
 a step function and integral.

308
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,010
 It's very easy there.

309
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,200
 OK.

310
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,099
 But after this, you see it

311
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:55,219
 doesn't make any difference

312
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:57,059
 to choose X tilde here or X

313
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,359
 because for the integral,

314
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:01,320
 it does not matter what happens

315
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,140
 on a set with measure

316
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:03,729
 zero.

317
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,299
 And in the last video, I

318
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:06,799
 have shown it explicitly

319
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:07,969
 for the step functions.

320
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:09,929
 OK.

321
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,849
 Now we have an

322
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:12,729
 inequality that holds

323
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:14,530
 for all epsilon here on the

324
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:16,409
 right hand side, this

325
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:18,219
 means now that we can choose

326
00:09:18,229 --> 00:09:19,630
 the epsilon as

327
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,340
 small as we want.

328
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,900
 And therefore we have a

329
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:25,719
 limit process for the epsilon

330
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:26,989
 and still have the

331
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,650
 inequality if we

332
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:30,530
 would set epsilon to

333
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:31,289
 zero.

334
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:33,159
 So this means here we

335
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:34,750
 have the integral greater

336
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,390
 or equal than the

337
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,229
 integral.

338
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:38,469
 And here just h

339
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:39,909
 remains.

340
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:43,270
 Now in the same sense,

341
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,909
 this h was arbitrarily

342
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,479
 chosen.

343
00:09:45,989 --> 00:09:47,669
 It was just a step function

344
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,229
 that lies below our

345
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,299
 function F.

346
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,940
 This means now that we can

347
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,909
 go to the supremum

348
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,049
 over all the step

349
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:56,880
 functions.

350
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,229
 And then we get on the right

351
00:09:58,239 --> 00:09:59,940
 hand side, the integral of

352
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,710
 F and there you have

353
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:01,960
 it.

354
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,630
 This is the second part of

355
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,260
 our equality star.

356
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,070
 Both things together

357
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,960
 gives us the proof of the

358
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:10,789
 monotone convergence theorem.

359
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,330
 OK.

360
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,719
 For the end of the video,

361
00:10:13,849 --> 00:10:15,450
 I want to show you an

362
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,090
 application of this very

363
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:18,869
 important monotone convergence

364
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,320
 theorem.

365
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,409
 One can always use this

366
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:24,409
 for series if

367
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:26,309
 you have any sequence of

368
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,960
 functions, then I use now the

369
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:29,799
 letter G that are

370
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:31,479
 non-negative and also

371
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:32,369
 measurable.

372
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,119
 Then you can apply the

373
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,900
 monotone convergence theorem.

374
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,219
 So here I use also to assume

375
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:41,030
 the infinity for the functions

376
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:43,179
 and measurable.

377
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,659
 So we don't need a monotonic

378
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:46,580
 behavior here.

379
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,770
 Then we can say that the

380
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,710
 series

381
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,239
 which now goes from one

382
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,140
 to infinity.

383
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,309
 This is also a well defined

384
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,010
 function and also measurable.

385
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:00,659
 The trick is now of course,

386
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:02,239
 that the partial sums

387
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,700
 form a monotonically

388
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,179
 increasing sequence of

389
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,840
 functions.

390
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:08,840
 Therefore, we can write down

391
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:10,539
 the integral of the

392
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:11,419
 series.

393
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,179
 So it goes to infinity.

394
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,539
 g n de mu

395
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,179
 is equal, putting

396
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,080
 the series outside the

397
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:20,599
 integrals

398
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:23,340
 So here's the series of

399
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,429
 the integrals

400
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,869
 So gn 

401
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:26,770
 d mu

402
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,729
 this means that the monotone

403
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:31,690
 convergence theorem allows

404
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,130
 us to switch

405
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,599
 integral and series.

406
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:36,520
 The only thing we have to

407
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,299
 put in is that we have

408
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:40,039
 non-negative measurable

409
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:41,880
 functions and we

410
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,469
 need no other assumptions

411
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:43,960
 at all.

412
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:46,049
 And there you see the power

413
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:47,710
 of this theorem, it gives

414
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:49,179
 you immediately such a nice

415
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,250
 property as this

416
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,309
 very well.

417
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,919
 That's all I wanted to tell

418
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:55,830
 you about the monotone convergence

419
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,369
 theorem.

420
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:58,150
 And I hope you learned

421
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,460
 how one can prove it.

422
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:01,179
 And more importantly, you

423
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,969
 now learned when you can

424
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:04,700
 apply it, you

425
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,169
 need a monotonically

426
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:07,559
 increasing sequence of

427
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,109
 functions that are non-

428
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:09,900
 negative.

429
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,150
 Later, we will see how we

430
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,909
 can weaken a little bit this

431
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:14,590
 assumption.

432
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:17,369
 However, for the moment this

433
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,969
 version here is powerful

434
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:19,409
 enough.

435
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:22,869
 In the following next videos

436
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,489
 we will talk about other

437
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,059
 convergence theorem that are

438
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,349
 also very important.

439
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,890
 I hope I see you there and

440
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,500
 of course, I wish you a nice

441
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:31,929
 day.

442
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:32,849
 Bye.
