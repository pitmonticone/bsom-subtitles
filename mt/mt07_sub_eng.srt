00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:02,789
 Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,920
 And I want to thank all the

3
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:06,480
 nice people that support

4
00:00:06,489 --> 00:00:08,159
 this channel on Steady

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,220
 here we continue

6
00:00:10,229 --> 00:00:11,869
 now our measure theory

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,720
 series and today

8
00:00:13,729 --> 00:00:15,600
 we do part seven.

9
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,889
 The most important topic

10
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:19,409
 for today will be the

11
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,930
 monotone convergence

12
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,469
 theorem.

13
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,319
 Before explaining this very

14
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:26,170
 important convergence theorem,

15
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:27,860
 I first want to start

16
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,670
 showing you some essential

17
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,870
 properties of the Lebesgue

18
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:31,719
 integral.

19
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:34,450
 Recall, we have introduced

20
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:36,349
 the Lebesgue integral for

21
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:36,700
 non-negative

22
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:38,669
 measurable

23
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,669
 functions defined on

24
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,610
 some measure space X.

25
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,389
 For such functions

26
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,880
 We now know that the Lebesgue

27
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,909
 integral is well-defined.

28
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,669
 And the notation we have

29
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,439
 chosen is this integral

30
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,990
 symbol where we put the measure

31
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,310
 space X here.

32
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:56,150
 The function F here and the

33
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,080
 measure itself goes in with

34
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,959
 the mu where mu is the

35
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,680
 measure defined on X.

36
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,540
 The integral is well-defined

37
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,510
 Now means that this

38
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,459
 symbol is a number

39
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,839
 between zero and

40
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:10,809
 infinity.

41
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,239
 And in the worst case, it

42
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,150
 could be the symbol infinity.

43
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,750
 Also recall

44
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,949
 this symbol was defined

45
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,940
 by a supremum over all

46
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:22,699
 step functions that lie point-

47
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:24,379
 wisely below F

48
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:26,150
 OK.

49
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,970
 Now I want to collect some

50
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,540
 properties that follow

51
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,430
 immediately from this definition.

52
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,110
 So let's choose two of

53
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,790
 these nice functions,

54
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,500
 which means they are non-

55
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,309
 negative and also

56
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,309
 measurable.

57
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,930
 Now we have the following.

58
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,849
 The first thing would be

59
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,290
 if both functions

60
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,389
 coincide,

61
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,650
 then also the

62
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,290
 integrals coincide.

63
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,989
 However, of course, this

64
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,470
 is trivially fulfilled.

65
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,019
 Therefore, I want to weaken

66
00:01:58,029 --> 00:01:59,129
 the left hand side a little

67
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:01,040
 bit here, I want

68
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,639
 the functions to be equal

69
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,849
 mu-almost

70
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,699
 everywhere.

71
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,169
 The abbreviation one chooses

72
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,949
 here is always A

73
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:10,029
 E.

74
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,009
 So mu A E means

75
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,910
 mu-almost everywhere.

76
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,350
 This means now that the

77
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,320
 functions don't have to be

78
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,199
 equal, but they should be

79
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,119
 equal almost everywhere

80
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,839
 with respect to the measure

81
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,839
 mu. more

82
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,679
 concretely

83
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,259
 This whole property here

84
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,559
 means that you

85
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,160
 look at the set

86
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:33,399
 of all

87
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,210
 lowercase X in

88
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,139
 our X for

89
00:02:37,149 --> 00:02:38,830
 which this property

90
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:40,119
 does not hold.

91
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,770
 So you have F of

92
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:43,679
 X unequal to

93
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,919
 G of X,

94
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,220
 then this whole set

95
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:48,919
 should be of measure

96
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:50,619
 zero with respect to our

97
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,460
 measure mu.

98
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,770
 In other words, if you put

99
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:55,369
 the whole set into the measure,

100
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:57,210
 you get out zero.

101
00:02:58,809 --> 00:03:00,210
 This means that the Lebesgue

102
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,800
 integral cannot see

103
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:03,559
 things that happen on

104
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,869
 zero measure sets.

105
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,509
 Maybe for visualization,

106
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,110
 it's good to recall what

107
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:11,020
 we had for the Riemann integral.

108
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:13,710
 If you integrate a

109
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,509
 continuous function with

110
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,339
 our classical Riemann integral,

111
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,460
 you get out the

112
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,139
 area between

113
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:23,130
 the graph function and the

114
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:23,839
 X axis.

115
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:26,100
 And now if you change the

116
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,789
 function at one point,

117
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:29,970
 so the result is a non-

118
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:31,710
 continuous function now

119
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,139
 and then of course, you don't

120
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:36,029
 change the area here at

121
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,729
 all, which then

122
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,669
 means the integral is

123
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:41,410
 the same for

124
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:42,240
 Lebesgue integral.

125
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,649
 Now, this works in an

126
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,889
 abstract sense

127
00:03:45,899 --> 00:03:47,009
 which means that you can

128
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,720
 change the function as much

129
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,559
 as you want.

130
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,460
 As long as the set

131
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,339
 of all these changes

132
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,679
 has measure zero.

133
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:57,039
 I will talk about this later

134
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:57,899
 in another video.

135
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,380
 When I show you a lot of

136
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:01,190
 examples. Here, I

137
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,500
 want to continue with the

138
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,389
 second property which is

139
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,539
 the monotonicity.

140
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,699
 It is descriptively given

141
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,699
 by saying that if a function

142
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,449
 is bigger than another one,

143
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,419
 then also the area here

144
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:14,320
 should be bigger.

145
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:17,010
 However, as before we

146
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,450
 need the less of equal sign

147
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,790
 only almost

148
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:20,488
 everywhere.

149
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,890
 And then we can conclude

150
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,049
 that the integral of

151
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:25,700
 F is less or

152
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:27,700
 equal than the integral of

153
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:28,130
 G.

154
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,790
 And now to the last property

155
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:33,600
 which is related to the first

156
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:35,350
 one, I want my function

157
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,950
 F to be zero

158
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,790
 and also mu-

159
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:40,230
 almost everywhere.

160
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,989
 Now, by using a, I know

161
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,859
 that the integral of F

162
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,500
 is therefore also

163
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,429
 zero because the integral

164
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,890
 of the zero function is zero.

165
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,649
 However, here I want to emphasize

166
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,829
 another direction.

167
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,100
 If the function has an integral

168
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:57,750
 of zero, then we

169
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,459
 already know that the function

170
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,109
 has to be zero mu-

171
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:02,179
 almost everywhere.

172
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,260
 Please don't forget that

173
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:05,760
 we only consider non-negative

174
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:06,980
 functions here.

175
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:09,480
 So all the areas we consider

176
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:11,320
 are above the X axis and

177
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:12,230
 therefore positive.

178
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,019
 Therefore, there is no cancellation

179
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:16,700
 whatsoever with positive

180
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:17,429
 and negative

181
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,230
 Areas here.

182
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,230
 Well, now I could say

183
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,500
 all the three properties

184
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,829
 are easy to prove.

185
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,950
 So you could do this for

186
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,660
 yourself.

187
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,739
 However, I also want you

188
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,230
 to learn some

189
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:30,549
 technical steps here.

190
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:32,429
 And therefore I will do the

191
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,829
 proof of B

192
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,279
 after seeing this proof,

193
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,730
 I think you will be

194
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:39,369
 capable of doing the proof

195
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,170
 A and C for yourself.

196
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,190
 If not, please ask in the

197
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,040
 comments for

198
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:47,220
 starting the proof.

199
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,369
 Let us choose a

200
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,200
 simple function h.

201
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,130
 This means that we have a

202
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,549
 representation with

203
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,980
 characteristic functions.

204
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,489
 So we know we can write it

205
00:05:58,579 --> 00:05:59,910
 as a finite

206
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,690
 sum.

207
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,510
 Maybe we end with N

208
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:04,500
 and we have constant C

209
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,309
 I and also sets

210
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,959
 A I.

211
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,750
 When we put that into

212
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,179
 characteristic functions,

213
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,579
 the corresponding sets here

214
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:15,029
 should be measurable.

215
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,450
 And therefore, the simple

216
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,690
 function is always

217
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,579
 measurable.

218
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,920
 And the other property of

219
00:06:20,929 --> 00:06:22,470
 a simple function is that

220
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,750
 it only has

221
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,130
 finitely many

222
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,019
 values.

223
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,339
 Therefore, there's

224
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,209
 always a canonical way to

225
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,100
 write down a representation

226
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:33,589
 for a simple function.

227
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,769
 You're forming the sum over

228
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:36,959
 all the values.

229
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,309
 So you have T

230
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,130
 in and now comes

231
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,040
 the image of the simple function.

232
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:43,899
 And I write that as h

233
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,230
 of X,

234
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:47,890
 then instead of C, we just

235
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:49,790
 have this T and

236
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:51,769
 then comes the characteristic

237
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,269
 function of a

238
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,570
 set I will now

239
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:55,279
 describe

240
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,089
 there we have all the X

241
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,529
 points that

242
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,989
 fulfill that.

243
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,570
 If I put in this

244
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:04,380
 point in my function, I

245
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,209
 get out this special

246
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:06,690
 T.

247
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,019
 Do you see this is a

248
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,410
 representation that is

249
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,109
 allowed.

250
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,450
 And often it is very helpful

251
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:15,970
 to choose this special one

252
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,239
 because you don't have to

253
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,170
 define N or the CIS or

254
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:20,970
 the A is you just write down

255
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,519
 this representation.

256
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,579
 And also the integral

257
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:27,339
 can then easily be written

258
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,309
 down as

259
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,799
 always, it is defined by

260
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:31,720
 our sum.

261
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,630
 And our summation goes

262
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,429
 over T in the

263
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,739
 image of H

264
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:38,869
 and then simply T

265
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,829
 times the measure of

266
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,450
 this set.

267
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:42,119
 So we have

268
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,929
 mu of the

269
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,769
 whole set where I write all

270
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:47,119
 the X that

271
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,880
 fulfill HX

272
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,820
 equals to this T.

273
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:53,250
 And to make it a little bit

274
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,649
 easier, you can

275
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,309
 always ignore the zero.

276
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,799
 So you omit the zero as an

277
00:07:57,809 --> 00:07:59,350
 element in the image.

278
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:00,589
 And because you don't change

279
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,100
 anything for the integral

280
00:08:02,109 --> 00:08:03,519
 here by multiplying with

281
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:04,070
 zero.

282
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,029
 The question for you is now

283
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,910
 what happens if we

284
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,630
 change the simple

285
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,470
 function on a

286
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,220
 set which has measure

287
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,989
 zero in

288
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,309
 order to investigate this,

289
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,369
 I need a little space here.

290
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,309
 So we push this one

291
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,510
 here to the bottom now.

292
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,089
 OK, maybe a quick sketch

293
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,040
 is helpful here.

294
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,720
 So this is the whole measure

295
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,920
 space X.

296
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,350
 And now let us split that

297
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,670
 up into two sets.

298
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,669
 So this one would be the

299
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,390
 big X tilde.

300
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,609
 And of course, the complement,

301
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,249
 the whole rest is just

302
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:41,979
 X tilde c.

303
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,508
 The compliment of X tilde,

304
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,619
 this means that our x is

305
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,140
 now divided into two

306
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,820
 sets.

307
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,969
 We want that

308
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:52,820
 the x tilde

309
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,700
 complement has

310
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,820
 measured zero.

311
00:08:58,349 --> 00:08:59,969
 And with respect to this

312
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:01,289
 set, with measure zero, I

313
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,770
 want to change our simple

314
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,210
 function.

315
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,179
 And of course, I call it

316
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:07,140
 H tilde and define it

317
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,419
 by using two

318
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:09,200
 cases.

319
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,940
 The first case would be as

320
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,530
 before.

321
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:13,469
 So H tilda X

322
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:15,250
 is equal to HX for

323
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,250
 all X in

324
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,340
 X tilde.

325
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,880
 So nothing changes on the

326
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,559
 green set.

327
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:23,929
 But on the gray set, I will

328
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,809
 set it to a new value And

329
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,190
 I just choose an A.

330
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,289
 So this is for all X

331
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:30,349
 in X tilde

332
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:32,190
 compliment, and

333
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,869
 A is now just an arbitrary

334
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,739
 chosen positive number.

335
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,429
 So zero to infinity

336
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,219
 by definition, this is of

337
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:41,770
 course, again, a simple

338
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,760
 function because

339
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,650
 the set X tilde, I didn't

340
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:46,090
 say it.

341
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:47,169
 But of course, it should

342
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:48,739
 be in the Sigma algebra.

343
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,419
 So it should be measurable.

344
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,789
 And then we can write down

345
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,570
 again a representation

346
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,169
 for this step or simple

347
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:56,630
 function.

348
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,739
 I can use the representation

349
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,530
 from before.

350
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:01,409
 So now let's go over all

351
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:02,929
 the values of the

352
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,849
 original function h.

353
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:07,090
 And now I know it only

354
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:08,940
 occurs for X in

355
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,539
 X tilde.

356
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:11,289
 So I write down T

357
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:12,729
 times characteristic

358
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:13,359
 function.

359
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,409
 And now I put only the

360
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:17,320
 XS from X Tilde

361
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,000
 into this characteristic

362
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:19,450
 function.

363
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,549
 Not included in this sum

364
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,979
 is what happens outside of

365
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:23,630
 X tilde.

366
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,380
 And therefore we add

367
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:26,820
 this one as the value

368
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,179
 a times

369
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:29,900
 characteristic function.

370
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,770
 And now we have all the

371
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,409
 X

372
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,070
 in X where

373
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,809
 H tilda is equal to

374
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,599
 a but this is simply

375
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:40,070
 X tilde complement.

376
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:42,049
 So we can write in

377
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,739
 short just this

378
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,270
 X tilde compliment here.

379
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:46,940
 OK.

380
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,570
 I have explicitly written

381
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,559
 down the representation

382
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,210
 because then we can write

383
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,010
 down the integral as well.

384
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,919
 Now I of

385
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:56,500
 H tilde

386
00:10:58,429 --> 00:10:59,979
 equal to the

387
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:01,580
 sum with T

388
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,280
 over

389
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:03,940
 HX

390
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,450
 and you will have t times

391
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,150
 the measure of this

392
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,679
 set

393
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,250
 plus a times

394
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,890
 the measure of this set,

395
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,039
 which is again, X tilde

396
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:18,390
 the compliment.

397
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,359
 However, you already know

398
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,229
 the measure of X tilde compliment

399
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:23,799
 is zero.

400
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,270
 So this whole thing here

401
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,210
 on the right, it's

402
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,510
 still zero.

403
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:30,929
 That simply means we can

404
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,090
 just omit it.

405
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,179
 And now you should see the

406
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,140
 differences above and below

407
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,719
 are not so big.

408
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,419
 The only real difference

409
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:40,549
 is to tilde the here

410
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,340
 because the zero does not

411
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:43,280
 make any difference.

412
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:44,270
 As I said before,

413
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,929
 our task is now to

414
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,190
 fill in the middle ground

415
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,549
 here.

416
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,169
 Now, it depends what you

417
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:52,049
 find easier.

418
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:53,309
 So maybe we come from the

419
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,080
 bottom and just use

420
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:56,780
 what we know there.

421
00:11:56,789 --> 00:11:57,530
 So we have

422
00:11:58,429 --> 00:11:59,369
 mu of

423
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,380
 the whole X

424
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,580
 and now we just split it

425
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,919
 up into X tilde

426
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:08,000
 where the condition is fulfilled

427
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,359
 union.

428
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:12,820
 And here we have

429
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,409
 just x tilde

430
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:15,169
 C.

431
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,960
 Now, obviously this is the

432
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:21,409
 same as the bottom part.

433
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:23,169
 And we know it's a disjoint

434
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:25,119
 union which means we

435
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,030
 can easily use the sigma

436
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:27,919
 additivity  here.

437
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,099
 Therefore, parentheses here

438
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:32,539
 and here I write

439
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:33,950
 plus or

440
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,940
 maybe first close

441
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,760
 parenthesis here as well.

442
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:40,039
 So this would be black

443
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:42,960
 then plus

444
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,750
 mu of

445
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:46,090
 this set.

446
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,229
 However, we already know

447
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:51,150
 that X tilde complement

448
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:53,030
 is a set with measure

449
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,989
 zero with or without this

450
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,679
 condition, it only gets

451
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,070
 smaller with the condition,

452
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,989
 which means this is still

453
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,429
 a set with measure

454
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,030
 zero.

455
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,159
 And now we have all the

456
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:06,239
 equalities here.

457
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,059
 We just add a zero here.

458
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,179
 So this is equal and this

459
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,109
 is equal, everything is equal,

460
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,820
 which means the integral

461
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,710
 of H tilde is equal to

462
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:15,880
 the integral of H.

463
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:17,919
 This means now that we can

464
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:19,510
 change the simple function

465
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,219
 on a set with measure

466
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:22,919
 zero as much as we want.

467
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,780
 Indeed, this is a very important

468
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:26,469
 result.

469
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:27,900
 And you can use that

470
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,940
 for proving some of these

471
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,760
 parts here.

472
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:32,549
 But we wanted to prove part

473
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,010
 B

474
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,650
 there, we have two measurable

475
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:38,169
 functions whether one

476
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:39,820
 is bigger than the other

477
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,570
 one almost everywhere.

478
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,059
 Therefore, now we know how

479
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,690
 to choose our x tilde.

480
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,229
 It simply should be the

481
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:51,400
 set of all x

482
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,109
 where F of

483
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,700
 X is less or

484
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,469
 equal than G of

485
00:13:58,479 --> 00:13:59,239
 X.

486
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,169
 Then by assumption we

487
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:04,020
 also know that X tilde

488
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:05,640
 complement has

489
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,859
 measure zero.

490
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,140
 Well, then let's look at

491
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,960
 the integral of F

492
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:13,419
 by definition, it's the

493
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:14,849
 supremum of

494
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:16,659
 all integrals of step

495
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:17,510
 functions.

496
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,200
 And we denoted them by S

497
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,159
 plus where the

498
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:23,500
 step function or the simple

499
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,219
 function is less or

500
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:26,909
 equal than F.

501
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,869
 Now by the results from

502
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,650
 before we know that we

503
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:33,340
 don't change the integral

504
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:35,000
 value when we change the

505
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,739
 step function on a

506
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,260
 set with measure zero.

507
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:40,179
 Therefore, the supremum is

508
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,719
 still the same when I put

509
00:14:41,729 --> 00:14:43,299
 in our step functions

510
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,080
 where I have H

511
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,760
 tilde less than

512
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,159
 F but

513
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:49,929
 only on

514
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,880
 X tilde.

515
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:54,429
 That is the whole point.

516
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,289
 If we change something outside

517
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:57,989
 of X tilde, we

518
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,789
 can't change I of

519
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,690
 H tilde.

520
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:02,820
 So the whole supremum is the

521
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,059
 same as the supremum here

522
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:04,710
 on the left.

523
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,609
 Very good.

524
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:08,200
 And now we can use what we

525
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,859
 know from F and

526
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:11,549
 G on

527
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:13,500
 X tilde G

528
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,969
 is always bigger than F.

529
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:16,419
 So we have here

530
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:17,719
 always this

531
00:15:17,729 --> 00:15:18,500
 inequality.

532
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:21,090
 Hence, if we write down the

533
00:15:21,099 --> 00:15:22,549
 same thing again,

534
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,659
 but now with G

535
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:26,020
 instead of F,

536
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,989
 then this set gets

537
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,830
 bigger than this set because

538
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,640
 there are more step functions

539
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,640
 maybe inside this set.

540
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:35,200
 Therefore, we have an

541
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,010
 inequality at

542
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,869
 this point.

543
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,500
 Now with the same reasoning

544
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,309
 as before the supremum

545
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,059
 is equal to the

546
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,739
 supremum where I

547
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,739
 ignore x tilde and

548
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,049
 use step functions

549
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,289
 on the whole set X.

550
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,940
 And this one is

551
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,549
 exactly the definition of

552
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:58,440
 the integral of

553
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,859
 our function G.

554
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,539
 And if we put everything

555
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:04,380
 together, so this one, the

556
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,070
 inequality and this

557
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,000
 one, we have proven our

558
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,950
 claim and this

559
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,789
 is the monotonicity property

560
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,429
 of the Lebesgue integral where

561
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,960
 we only need this

562
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:16,109
 inequality

563
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:17,900
 almost everywhere.

564
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:18,760
 OK.

565
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,549
 So this one was a long

566
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,229
 proof and I showed you all

567
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:23,549
 the technical details

568
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,869
 because we need them again.

569
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,909
 When we prove the monotone

570
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:29,150
 convergence theorem.

571
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:31,349
 However, maybe let's

572
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,669
 first state the

573
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,299
 monotone convergence

574
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:34,770
 theorem.

575
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,559
 Remember this was our

576
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,369
 goal from the beginning of

577
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,000
 the video.

578
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,250
 The first condition is that

579
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,099
 we have a measure space.

580
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:47,820
 So set X Sigma algebra

581
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:49,460
 and a measure mu.

582
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,880
 And we also have some

583
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:52,409
 nonne

584
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,119
 measurable

585
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,000
 functions

586
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:57,299
 FN and

587
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:57,979
 F

588
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:01,840
 from X to zero

589
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:02,919
 to infinity.

590
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:04,680
 And as I said, they are

591
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:06,368
 measurable for

592
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,300
 all N in

593
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:08,719
 N.

594
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:12,160
 And in addition, they

595
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,650
 satisfy two

596
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,719
 properties.

597
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:16,170
 First, they are

598
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,420
 monotonically

599
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,348
 increasing.

600
00:17:19,598 --> 00:17:21,388
 So we have F one less or

601
00:17:21,398 --> 00:17:23,348
 equal than F two, less or

602
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:24,858
 equal than F three

603
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,188
 and so on.

604
00:17:26,198 --> 00:17:27,338
 And this holds

605
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,430
 almost everywhere.

606
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:30,349
 So mu

607
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,349
 almost everywhere.

608
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,650
 This always means that the

609
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,560
 points X where this condition

610
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:38,150
 is not satisfied

611
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,069
 form a set with

612
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,189
 measure zero.

613
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,329
 And the second condition

614
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:45,109
 is that the pointwise

615
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:46,510
 limit of the

616
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,189
 sequence of functions

617
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:51,060
 is equal to

618
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,819
 F of X

619
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,900
 also mu

620
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,739
 almost everywhere

621
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:58,920
 for X in X.

622
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:00,910
 OK.

623
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,660
 Here is now an X and we

624
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,079
 say it holds almost

625
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:06,050
 everywhere which just means

626
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,709
 OK, there is a set X tilde

627
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,459
 where this one holds and

628
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:11,000
 a compliment of X tilde

629
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,510
 has measured zero.

630
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,099
 And this one is just the

631
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:16,040
 common abbreviation of this.

632
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:18,329
 So we just say X and X mu-

633
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:19,680
 almost everywhere and then

634
00:18:19,689 --> 00:18:21,380
 everyone knows what we mean.

635
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,900
 And now the monotone

636
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,900
 convergence theorem states

637
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,359
 that we can push the

638
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:30,180
 limit inside

639
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:31,319
 the integral.

640
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,660
 Hence the limit of

641
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,939
 the integrals

642
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:36,469
 f n d mu

643
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,349
 is equal to OK.

644
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,040
 Limit inside means

645
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,449
 integral over

646
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:43,329
 X.

647
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:45,020
 And the limit inside is

648
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,989
 just the function F

649
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,359
 mu-almost everywhere.

650
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:49,550
 So we can put

651
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,209
 f dmu here.

652
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,540
 And that is the convergence

653
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,030
 theorem.

654
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,930
 Now, you know, when you

655
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:57,469
 can push the limit

656
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:59,219
 inside the, the call, when

657
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:01,189
 you have a monotonic sequence

658
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:01,910
 of functions.

659
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,489
 Indeed, such convergence

660
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,579
 theorems are

661
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:07,300
 mostly the best

662
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,989
 advantages the

663
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,430
 Lebesgue integral has over

664
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:11,510
 the Riemann integral.

665
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,199
 And therefore, I really want

666
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:15,869
 to show you the proof of

667
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,130
 this monotone

668
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,359
 convergence theorem.

669
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:20,959
 However, this is a thing

670
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:22,550
 we will do in the next video

671
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,300
 because this video is

672
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:26,239
 already very long

673
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:28,859
 and it is good to do a short

674
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:29,339
 break.

675
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:31,770
 Maybe now recall

676
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,630
 everything we did here in

677
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,390
 this video.

678
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:36,260
 And then maybe you can

679
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,930
 come to the next video where

680
00:19:37,939 --> 00:19:39,329
 we do the proof of the

681
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:40,979
 monotone convergence

682
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:41,489
 theorem.

683
00:19:42,209 --> 00:19:43,469
 I really hope you will be

684
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:43,849
 there.

685
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:45,739
 So then see you next

686
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,030
 time.
