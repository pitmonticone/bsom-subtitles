00:00:00,579 --> 00:00:02,170
 Hello and welcome

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:02,720
 back.

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,519
 First, let me thank all the

4
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,219
 nice people that support

5
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,760
 this channel on Steady.

6
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,539
 And now let's continue with

7
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,439
 measure theory namely

8
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:14,069
 with part six.

9
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:17,420
 And we will finally talk

10
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,190
 about the Lebesgue integral but

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,639
 first about the Lebesgue

12
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:22,399
 integral of so

13
00:00:22,409 --> 00:00:24,280
 called-step functions.

14
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,920
 So we will learn how to

15
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,799
 integrate functions that

16
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:30,120
 are defined on an

17
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,840
 abstract measure space.

18
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,619
 As a short recap, a

19
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,240
 measure space is

20
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,709
 nothing more than a

21
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,400
 triple.

22
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,330
 There.

23
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,779
 We have a set X,

24
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:42,770
 a sigma algebra A

25
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,470
 and also a measure

26
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,009
 mu.

27
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,779
 This means that X could

28
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,080
 be any set

29
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,979
 but A is a special

30
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,580
 collection of subsets of

31
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,049
 X.

32
00:00:54,529 --> 00:00:56,189
 And the third ingredient,

33
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,040
 the measure mu itself is

34
00:00:58,049 --> 00:00:59,750
 indeed a map

35
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:02,139
 where the domain is the sigma

36
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,880
 algebra A and the co-

37
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:05,290
 domain is the

38
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,980
 interval included

39
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:08,580
 zero and also

40
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:10,220
 included the symbol

41
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,910
 infinity.

42
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,580
 Now, with respect to

43
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:15,519
 this abstract measure

44
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:16,870
 space, we want to

45
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,720
 integrate some special

46
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,510
 functions.

47
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,139
 Indeed what we need are

48
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,089
 measurable maps defined in

49
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:25,970
 the last video I

50
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,559
 will use the letter F for

51
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:29,529
 such maps that start

52
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,529
 with X and go into

53
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,730
 the real number line.

54
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:35,610
 Now you should not forget

55
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,519
 that we have a Sigma algebra

56
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:39,089
 on the left namely

57
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,970
 A and also a Sigma

58
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,150
 algebra on the right.

59
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,040
 And there we have the Borel

60
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:45,370
 Sigma algebra.

61
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,309
 Also recall

62
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,309
 that measurable means

63
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,209
 that all the preimages

64
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,959
 from elements from the sigma

65
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,910
 algebra here lie

66
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:57,230
 in the sigma algebra A.

67
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,110
 In other

68
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,860
 words, preimage

69
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,720
 of a set

70
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,599
 E is in

71
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,519
 A for all

72
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:08,100
 Borel sets E

73
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,139
 OK.

74
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:10,839
 So these are the functions

75
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,160
 where we want to be able

76
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:13,940
 to integrate them in the

77
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:14,320
 end.

78
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,910
 However, at the moment,

79
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:18,910
 they might be too complicated.

80
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,470
 So we start with functions

81
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,589
 that we already know.

82
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:24,070
 For example, we already

83
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,710
 know that the characteristic

84
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,669
 function is a measurable

85
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:28,309
 map.

86
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,229
 If we choose a measurable

87
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,669
 set,

88
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,240
 this means A

89
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,350
 lies in the Sigma algebra.

90
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:38,020
 We already know how to sketch

91
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:39,080
 this function.

92
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,619
 If we have our abstract X

93
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,179
 here on the line

94
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,059
 and maybe this

95
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,539
 is the set A.

96
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:48,550
 So these two things together

97
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:50,529
 are A, then we

98
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:52,479
 can sketch the graph of

99
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,029
 our characteristic function.

100
00:02:56,149 --> 00:02:57,820
 It will be zero here

101
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,789
 and has to value you

102
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,759
 one where the set A

103
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,279
 lies.

104
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:04,179
 So here it will be one and

105
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,490
 here also zero

106
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,720
 and there also zero

107
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,160
 for visualization of the

108
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:12,059
 integral, it's always

109
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,000
 good to see the integral

110
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:15,970
 as the area below

111
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:16,779
 the graph

112
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:17,960
 And the x axis

113
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,809
 here, this would mean we

114
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,550
 look at this area

115
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:22,190
 here

116
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,190
 and the area here.

117
00:03:29,149 --> 00:03:30,639
 And because the value of

118
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:32,289
 the function is just one,

119
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,250
 it does not matter how abstract

120
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:35,330
 this whole measure space

121
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:37,130
 is, this area should

122
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:39,130
 be exactly the same as

123
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:41,009
 the volume, the measure

124
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,279
 of the set A

125
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,380
 or in other words, a

126
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:46,059
 meaningful integral

127
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,740
 notion.

128
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,179
 And maybe let's call it just

129
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,330
 by capital I

130
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,369
 of this characteristic

131
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,899
 function should always

132
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,460
 fulfill that.

133
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,039
 This integral

134
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,029
 is the measure of the

135
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,949
 set A.

136
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:01,470
 Now we have a new symbol

137
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,020
 on the left I of a

138
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:03,800
 function.

139
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:05,750
 So you should read this indeed,

140
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,149
 as a definition,

141
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,270
 this means now you know

142
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:12,210
 how to integrate characteristic

143
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:12,740
 functions.

144
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:15,050
 In fact, there are other

145
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:16,329
 functions where we can

146
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,079
 define the integral

147
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,798
 also in such a simple

148
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:20,190
 way.

149
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,269
 And these are called simple

150
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,089
 functions.

151
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,649
 There are also a lot of other

152
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,570
 names that one uses for such

153
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:28,649
 simple functions.

154
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:30,940
 For example, step

155
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,470
 functions as I

156
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,029
 did in the

157
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,640
 title of this video

158
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:36,940
 and also

159
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,859
 staircase functions

160
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:41,100
 and also other

161
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:41,839
 names.

162
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,489
 And you see the name

163
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,359
 might not be important.

164
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,809
 You just have to know what

165
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,730
 such simple functions are.

166
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:51,429
 In short.

167
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,220
 A simple function F

168
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,730
 is just a linear

169
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:56,660
 combination of such

170
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,140
 characteristic functions.

171
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,130
 This means you can write

172
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,890
 F of X as a

173
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:02,739
 sum.

174
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,170
 Where we will start with

175
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,070
 one and go to a fixed

176
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,820
 N and where we

177
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:09,679
 have numbers C

178
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,149
 I and

179
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,649
 characteristic functions

180
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,250
 corresponding to some

181
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,209
 measurable set A

182
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,850
 I.

183
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:19,809
 In other words, a

184
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:21,779
 function F is called

185
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,559
 simple.

186
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,910
 If you can find

187
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,809
 measurable sets A_1

188
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,869
 till A_n

189
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,390
 and real numbers c_1

190
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,200
 to c_n

191
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,839
 such that you can write the

192
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,600
 function in this form

193
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,899
 because we know that the

194
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,260
 characteristic functions

195
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:40,100
 are measurable and also

196
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:42,000
 sums of measurable

197
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,959
 maps are also measurable.

198
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:45,910
 We also know that this

199
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,160
 simple function is

200
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,000
 therefore

201
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:49,239
 measurable.

202
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,040
 Also here, I would

203
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:53,700
 say to get some

204
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:55,500
 visualization, let's

205
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,049
 sketch the graph of such

206
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:57,899
 a simple function.

207
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,709
 This is the same as before.

208
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,619
 So we have X here and

209
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,540
 R here and

210
00:06:04,549 --> 00:06:06,540
 maybe here now we have set

211
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:08,450
 A_1 and

212
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:09,769
 here a set A_2

213
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:10,470
 .

214
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:12,160
 And let's choose a split

215
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,869
 set A three here.

216
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:17,980
 And for these sets, we can

217
00:06:17,989 --> 00:06:19,589
 now choose some

218
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,100
 constant c_i.

219
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:23,100
 Hence, we have for the graph

220
00:06:23,109 --> 00:06:24,869
 of the function some value

221
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,609
 here over A_1,

222
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,220
 another value over A_2

223
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,209
 here.

224
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,239
 And maybe a lower one

225
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,010
 here for A_3

226
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,820
 and outside of this set, we

227
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,089
 are just at zero.

228
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,420
 If we now go back to our

229
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:41,760
 visualization of the

230
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,420
 integral, we know it's given

231
00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:44,459
 by rectangles.

232
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,320
 For example, here we have

233
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:47,320
 the rectangle

234
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:51,549
 with length given by a

235
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:53,239
 one and the height

236
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,640
 given by C one.

237
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:57,420
 Therefore, this rectangle

238
00:06:57,429 --> 00:06:58,549
 here just

239
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,160
 represents the part of the

240
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,959
 integral that is given

241
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,799
 by C one times the

242
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:05,540
 measure of a one.

243
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,820
 And the contribution for

244
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,359
 the integral given by the

245
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:12,100
 set A two is just

246
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:13,500
 this rectangle here.

247
00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:16,130
 And of course, now given

248
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,609
 by C two

249
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:19,329
 times the measure

250
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,570
 of A two.

251
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:22,489
 And then the last part is

252
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,410
 coming from a three which

253
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,790
 consists of three parts.

254
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:27,779
 But in the sum, of course,

255
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,230
 this is also C

256
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:30,660
 three times the

257
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,149
 measure of a

258
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,709
 three.

259
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,010
 And now you should see that

260
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:36,790
 we just have to add

261
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:37,690
 up all these

262
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,500
 contributions to get the

263
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,929
 full integral, to get the

264
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,890
 full area in this picture.

265
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,540
 Hence, again, for

266
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:46,920
 meaningful integral

267
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:48,899
 definition, we need a sum

268
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,149
 of all these parts.

269
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,859
 So I of

270
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:53,700
 F is then

271
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:55,700
 given by a sum

272
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:58,869
 and they have the same C

273
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,549
 I as before, but

274
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:02,549
 now not the characteristic

275
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,589
 function but the

276
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,480
 corresponding measures

277
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,750
 of the sets.

278
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:10,510
 And indeed, this will be

279
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,380
 our integral for

280
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,070
 simple functions in the end.

281
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,399
 However, at the moment,

282
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,950
 you should see immediately

283
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,929
 one problem with this definition.

284
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:24,049
 What happens if we have

285
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:25,480
 a set with volume

286
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:26,480
 infinity?

287
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:28,040
 So that this number

288
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,640
 here is the symbol

289
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:30,559
 infinity.

290
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,429
 There we could have for example,

291
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,469
 three as the C

292
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,349
 times infinity.

293
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,549
 Maybe that's not a problem

294
00:08:39,558 --> 00:08:40,909
 for you because it's just

295
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,460
 infinity itself again.

296
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,179
 But then what happens if

297
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,109
 the next C here is

298
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:48,070
 minus two and it measures

299
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,150
 also infinity.

300
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,979
 And of course, this is not

301
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,890
 simply just one infinity.

302
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,260
 This is not defined at the

303
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:55,770
 moment.

304
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,469
 In fact, we have a

305
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:00,229
 problem with the definition

306
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:00,859
 in general.

307
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:04,140
 In order to solve this problem,

308
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:05,539
 there are essentially two

309
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:06,770
 ways one can go.

310
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,510
 Now on the one

311
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,179
 hand, one can restrict

312
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,039
 oneself to such simple

313
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:13,979
 functions where the corresponding

314
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,020
 AIS only have

315
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,200
 finite measure.

316
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,559
 Obviously, then there's no

317
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,429
 problem with such infinities

318
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,659
 because there is no simple

319
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:24,020
 infinity involved in the

320
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,750
 whole sum.

321
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,049
 And on the other hand, one

322
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:28,789
 can demand that these

323
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,179
 constants have to be

324
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,119
 positive, then there

325
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,650
 might be infinity in the

326
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:35,609
 sun, but only with the same

327
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:36,250
 sign.

328
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,280
 And then of course, we don't

329
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:39,830
 have a problem adding up

330
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,380
 positive infinities.

331
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:44,030
 And exactly this second

332
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,890
 possibility is the way

333
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,159
 I want to go here.

334
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:49,960
 Now, finally, we can put

335
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:51,929
 the integral into a

336
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,799
 definition

337
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,520
 for this.

338
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,440
 We will consider now, just

339
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,299
 functions defined on X.

340
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,809
 And as before, there should

341
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,719
 be step or simple

342
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:03,409
 functions.

343
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,880
 Moreover, we want now to

344
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,859
 consider only the positive

345
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:09,659
 ones or more concretely

346
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:11,460
 the non-negative ones.

347
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:13,979
 The whole set of such

348
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,380
 functions is now

349
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,150
 denoted by a

350
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,059
 curved S where I put

351
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,460
 in A plus

352
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,609
 and this S plus is now

353
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:25,609
 almost a vector space

354
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,559
 in the sense that we can

355
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,090
 add functions as we want.

356
00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:30,909
 But we can't scale them as

357
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,369
 we want because

358
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,309
 only positive scalars are

359
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,799
 allowed otherwise we would

360
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:36,780
 leave this space.

361
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:38,570
 So you should imagine

362
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,169
 this as a half space.

363
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,179
 If we go now back to our

364
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,719
 definition of simple

365
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:45,859
 functions, you

366
00:10:45,869 --> 00:10:47,599
 immediately recognize

367
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,239
 that this representation

368
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,880
 here is not unique for the

369
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:51,599
 function F.

370
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,030
 For example, we could split

371
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,760
 the set A two into two

372
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,429
 parts.

373
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:58,140
 And then we have one

374
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,119
 term in addition in

375
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,080
 the sum here, but

376
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,760
 it does not change the function

377
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:04,700
 F itself.

378
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,119
 So the graph looks still

379
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,799
 the same just this

380
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:09,119
 sum is different.

381
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,809
 Therefore, another description

382
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,710
 which is independent of this

383
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:15,309
 representation for a simple

384
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,809
 function would be

385
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:19,700
 I have a measurable

386
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,369
 function.

387
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,739
 And it only takes

388
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,700
 finitely many values.

389
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,549
 In this case, I can always

390
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,309
 find such a representation

391
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,630
 here.

392
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,780
 The idea is now

393
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:32,400
 always choose a

394
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:33,380
 suitable

395
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,969
 representation for your

396
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:36,140
 simple function F.

397
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,770
 In our case here, if

398
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,609
 F comes from our S

399
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:41,440
 plus,

400
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,479
 then choose a representation

401
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:46,640
 as always.

402
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,520
 So we can write it as a sum.

403
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,289
 But now where the c_i's

404
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:52,770
 are also non-

405
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,559
 negative.

406
00:11:55,109 --> 00:11:56,580
 Of course, if the function

407
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,049
 is non-negative, then we

408
00:11:58,059 --> 00:11:59,669
 can always choose such a

409
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,570
 representation.

410
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,679
 And now it's very easy

411
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,419
 to define the Lebesgue integral.

412
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:08,320
 So this is our new notion

413
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,570
 and of course, often we will

414
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,419
 ignore the Lebesgue and

415
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:13,710
 just speak of the

416
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,530
 integral because this is

417
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:17,530
 the integral we define here.

418
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:19,789
 And to be more concrete,

419
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,190
 we also would say with

420
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,799
 respect to our

421
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,409
 given measure mu.

422
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:27,349
 And this integral is now

423
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:29,070
 given as we already

424
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,510
 know.

425
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,390
 And also denoted by

426
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,340
 I of F where we

427
00:12:33,349 --> 00:12:34,859
 just add up

428
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,780
 the measures of the

429
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,539
 sets A I where we

430
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,530
 scale them also by the

431
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:41,169
 CIS.

432
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,260
 So we have C I

433
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,900
 times the measure

434
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:46,369
 of A I.

435
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,590
 And because the C I are

436
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:51,409
 non-negative and the measure

437
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:53,090
 itself is non-negative or

438
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:54,260
 in the worst case just

439
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,030
 infinity, we know this

440
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:58,020
 integral is now also in the

441
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,729
 interval zero

442
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,390
 to infinity where we

443
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,090
 include both parts.

444
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:05,479
 One fact I can give you

445
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:07,299
 immediately this definition

446
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:08,929
 for integral is a

447
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,400
 well-defined

448
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,400
 object.

449
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,940
 This means that it does not

450
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,520
 depend on the chosen

451
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,320
 representation for our simple

452
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,380
 function F.

453
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:20,859
 So if you choose another

454
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:22,260
 representation with this

455
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,260
 property, you get the same

456
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,099
 number out, maybe

457
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:27,489
 this is a thing you could

458
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,580
 try to prove.

459
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,070
 However, of course, the

460
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,369
 visualization should be the

461
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,369
 important thing.

462
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:35,280
 So it does not matter how

463
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:36,750
 you split up these

464
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,919
 rectangles here.

465
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,710
 Yeah, the sum or the sum

466
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,630
 of the areas should be always

467
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,330
 the same no

468
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,929
 matter how you split up the

469
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,809
 set here on the X axis or

470
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,659
 you split up the C

471
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:50,359
 values on the Y axis.

472
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:52,700
 In other words, it makes

473
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,270
 sense that this integral

474
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,760
 here is indeed well-

475
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,369
 defined.

476
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,359
 And finally, I can give you

477
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:01,099
 the usual notation one

478
00:14:01,109 --> 00:14:02,419
 uses for the integral,

479
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,900
 of course, an integral sign,

480
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,640
 we put the set X

481
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,280
 here then comes the

482
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:10,010
 function F and

483
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,530
 then the measure mu

484
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:13,380
 by d

485
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:13,929
 mu

486
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,530
 sometimes also a

487
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:17,950
 variable is needed.

488
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,650
 And the notation looks almost

489
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:20,349
 the same.

490
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:21,830
 So you just

491
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,549
 include a variable

492
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,950
 name for the function.

493
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,440
 So a lower case X

494
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,030
 here and then d mu

495
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,619
 X.

496
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,890
 So this is the Lebesgue integral

497
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:34,729
 for step or

498
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:35,890
 simple functions.

499
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,219
 The idea is now that we

500
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:40,059
 expand this definition

501
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,489
 such that we can also

502
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,159
 integrate more complicated

503
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:43,809
 functions.

504
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,340
 But before we do that, let's

505
00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:48,320
 first look at some properties

506
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,719
 this integral has

507
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:51,919
 firstly, it is

508
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:53,489
 almost linear.

509
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,590
 I already told you

510
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:57,130
 we almost have vector

511
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,030
 space for our S plus.

512
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:00,630
 And in this sense, it's

513
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,450
 linear, we

514
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,900
 just have to restrict the

515
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:05,890
 scalars to non-negative

516
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,679
 numbers.

517
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,780
 And then we can pull out

518
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:09,900
 the addition sign.

519
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,809
 And also the scalars,

520
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:14,250
 hence this equality

521
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,809
 holds for all simple

522
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,640
 functions FG and

523
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,010
 for all scalars

524
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:21,070
 alpha beta greater

525
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,299
 or equal to zero.

526
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:25,010
 And of course, this immediately

527
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,820
 comes from this sum here.

528
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:29,979
 Also by using a, we

529
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:31,780
 can now show that if we

530
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:33,070
 have a step function or a

531
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,940
 simple function that is always

532
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,219
 bigger than another one,

533
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:37,989
 so we have F less or

534
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,140
 equal than G,

535
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,419
 then also the area

536
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,280
 between the graph

537
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:44,780
 and the X axis should be

538
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:46,619
 bigger for G than for F.

539
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,349
 And of course, this is what

540
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,359
 the integral tells us.

541
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:51,280
 So I of F

542
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,179
 is also less or equal

543
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,960
 than I of G.

544
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,599
 And this is what one calls

545
00:15:57,609 --> 00:15:58,710
 monotonicity.

546
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,270
 In fact, this monotonic

547
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,109
 behavior is what we now

548
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:04,989
 can use to expand our

549
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,729
 definition to

550
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:08,729
 general measurable maps

551
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,250
 in order to get a

552
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,039
 visualization, let's

553
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:13,919
 sketch again a graph.

554
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:16,619
 Now this is the graph of

555
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,119
 some measurable map

556
00:16:18,349 --> 00:16:20,049
 which is not a simple function.

557
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:20,840
 As you can see.

558
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:23,299
 Now, the integral should

559
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:25,130
 be now again represented

560
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,940
 by the area below

561
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,880
 the graph and the X axis.

562
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,429
 However, we only have this

563
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,190
 notion for the moment for

564
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,469
 the simple functions.

565
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,390
 And as you know, by now,

566
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,090
 a simple function has

567
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:39,469
 only finitely many

568
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,260
 values.

569
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,770
 And this blue curve here

570
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,650
 shows you there are infinitely

571
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:44,770
 many values.

572
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:46,929
 The whole idea of the Lebesgue

573
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,770
 integration is now to

574
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,440
 approximate the function

575
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,830
 by finitely many

576
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,469
 values.

577
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:55,530
 So I just choose some values

578
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:57,010
 here on the y axis

579
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,549
 such that the whole

580
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:00,320
 curve is in some sense

581
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,049
 covered.

582
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,020
 And now the idea is to

583
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,800
 define a suitable

584
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,848
 simple function.

585
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:09,608
 Therefore, maybe I choose

586
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:11,159
 this interval here

587
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:13,358
 and look what happens to

588
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:14,968
 the values of the function

589
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:15,588
 there.

590
00:17:15,878 --> 00:17:17,458
 And now you see we have two

591
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:19,358
 parts that are

592
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:21,138
 mapped to this

593
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:22,038
 interval here.

594
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:24,550
 For the X axis, this

595
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,489
 looks like this.

596
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,390
 So we have this part here

597
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,209
 that ends here

598
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,290
 and we have this part that

599
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,560
 starts here

600
00:17:32,949 --> 00:17:34,780
 and also ends

601
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,209
 here.

602
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:38,050
 This means we have one part

603
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,979
 of our set here and the other

604
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:41,530
 part here.

605
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,170
 And of course, this should

606
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,800
 be our set that we

607
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,430
 usually call A

608
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:48,270
 I.

609
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,729
 So this is just one A

610
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:50,810
 I and the

611
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,479
 corresponding C

612
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:54,349
 you find now here.

613
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,459
 So this would be our C I.

614
00:17:57,859 --> 00:17:59,750
 So I chose the lower part

615
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,199
 of the interval because then

616
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:03,199
 our step function is also

617
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,239
 below the graph of the

618
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:05,839
 function.

619
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:07,780
 So this would be the

620
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,040
 value of our step function

621
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:09,319
 here.

622
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,339
 And now you see all the other

623
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:14,040
 values on the Y axis

624
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,810
 give us the other

625
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:17,550
 c_i's and also the

626
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,180
 corresponding A_i's

627
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,880
 therefore, with this decomposition

628
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,640
 of the Y axis, we get

629
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,540
 out the usual step function

630
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,489
 where we have our C is there.

631
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:29,359
 And the so defined A

632
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:31,300
 is where we have now the

633
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,800
 characteristic function here.

634
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,359
 So this is a new simple function

635
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:36,630
 which I should call

636
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:37,420
 h now.

637
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,880
 And the important part is

638
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,729
 that h itself

639
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:43,010
 lies always

640
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,989
 below F so

641
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,609
 always below the graph that

642
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:47,479
 is blue here.

643
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:50,229
 Therefore, if we want to

644
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,209
 contain the monotonicity

645
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:53,619
 in the general integral,

646
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,390
 we now have an estimate

647
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,329
 for the real integral value

648
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:58,989
 of the function F.

649
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,160
 We know that the integral

650
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,709
 of this step function is

651
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:03,619
 smaller than the real

652
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,349
 integral.

653
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,020
 And this gives now rise to

654
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,380
 the following definition.

655
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:11,150
 Hence, we choose a positive

656
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,140
 or better a non-negative

657
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,500
 function F that is

658
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,099
 defined on our measure

659
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:17,060
 space X.

660
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,959
 And of course, it should

661
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:20,359
 be measurable.

662
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,260
 And now for each decomposition

663
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,060
 of the Y axis, we can

664
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:26,260
 choose such a

665
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,020
 step function or simple

666
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,920
 function h that lies

667
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,800
 pointwisely below

668
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,930
 the graph of the function

669
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:33,829
 F itself.

670
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,500
 And if we choose the function

671
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,369
 h out of the

672
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,760
 step function that are

673
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,660
 positive or non negative.

674
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,589
 So S plus, we know

675
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,790
 we can look at the

676
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,500
 integral of this

677
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,030
 h.

678
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,829
 What we have is then a whole

679
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,400
 set of integral

680
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,280
 values where the only condition

681
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,180
 is that our step function

682
00:19:55,189 --> 00:19:57,089
 is always below

683
00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:58,810
 the real function F.

684
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:02,900
 The general idea is now

685
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,599
 OK.

686
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:05,500
 So this integral value for

687
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,459
 the step function is always

688
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:08,939
 smaller than the

689
00:20:08,949 --> 00:20:10,859
 actual integral value for

690
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:12,150
 the function F.

691
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,609
 And we should get closer

692
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:15,160
 and closer to this value

693
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,040
 if we choose a finer and

694
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,890
 finer decomposition of the

695
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,800
 Y axis, so

696
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,359
 we approximate something

697
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:23,670
 with the set here.

698
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,040
 And of course, this should

699
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,859
 be the supremum of the

700
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:27,319
 set.

701
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,579
 In fact, this is what we

702
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:31,069
 choose as the

703
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,430
 definition of the

704
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,209
 integral for our function

705
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:34,800
 F.

706
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,560
 So we have F d mu

707
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:39,069
 and also this is our measure

708
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:39,900
 space X.

709
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,540
 So the integral of a nonne

710
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:45,089
 measurable map

711
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:47,089
 F is given

712
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:48,859
 by the supremum of

713
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:50,589
 all integral values for

714
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,130
 step functions that

715
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,989
 lie below the function

716
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,479
 F.

717
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,609
 And that is now the

718
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:58,119
 definition of the Lebesgue

719
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:59,089
 integral.

720
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,579
 And we also see this is well

721
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:02,910
 defined the

722
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,650
 supremum of a

723
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,550
 set in the real numbers always

724
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,390
 exists.

725
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:09,060
 In the worst case, it would

726
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:10,030
 be infinity.

727
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,400
 Therefore, in addition, we

728
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,300
 also have another definition

729
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,599
 F is called mu-integrable

730
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:20,780
 if the integral is

731
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,619
 finite.

732
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,739
 So it's not the symbol

733
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,699
 infinity.

734
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,219
 And there we have it, this

735
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:30,900
 is our result for today,

736
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,530
 the Lebesgue integral in

737
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,219
 complete generality

738
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,750
 because you see the only

739
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,420
 thing we needed here

740
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,969
 was a measure space

741
00:21:38,979 --> 00:21:39,599
 X.

742
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,430
 So we only needed to know

743
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:43,030
 how to measure the

744
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,030
 volumes of these sets

745
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,489
 on the X axis.

746
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,689
 However, what we use is that

747
00:21:48,699 --> 00:21:50,339
 we map into the real

748
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:51,069
 numbers.

749
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,910
 So indeed, here we have R

750
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,250
 on the Y axis.

751
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,770
 Therefore, we can do this

752
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,380
 decomposition, we can't do

753
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,310
 this decomposition on the

754
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,150
 X axis because there's no

755
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,089
 order is nothing more than

756
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:03,630
 just the measure.

757
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,469
 But on the y axis, we can

758
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:05,869
 do it.

759
00:22:06,949 --> 00:22:08,119
 Now, we should always keep

760
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,920
 in mind the Lebesgue integral

761
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,849
 is just defined within

762
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:13,689
 supremum where we use

763
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,369
 simple functions to

764
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,010
 define the integral first.

765
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,699
 So this was a long video

766
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:21,569
 today and I hope you

767
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:22,699
 learned something here.

768
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,270
 Of course, we had to define

769
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,290
 a lot of stuff.

770
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,270
 But in the end, you saw

771
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,400
 it is just a simple function

772
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,670
 where we can write down the

773
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,020
 integral immediately.

774
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,540
 And then the

775
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,469
 general integral is just

776
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:38,150
 an approximation concept.

777
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,540
 In the next video, I will

778
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,790
 continue with the Lebesgue

779
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,709
 integral and also

780
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:45,079
 write down a lot of

781
00:22:45,089 --> 00:22:46,939
 properties we have for it.

782
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,589
 And afterwards, you will

783
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:51,489
 finally see why the Lebesgue

784
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:53,560
 integral is so powerful,

785
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:56,180
 then have a nice day

786
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,890
 and see you next time.

787
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,920
 Bye.
