00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,250
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,259 --> 00:00:03,390
 measure theory.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,500
 And as always, first, I want

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,949
 to thank all the nice supporters

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,189
 on Steady or paypal.

6
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,609
 Now, in today's part three

7
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:12,199
 about outer measures, we

8
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,710
 will fill in some details

9
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,239
 of a proof.

10
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,590
 From the first video

11
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:17,959
 there, please recall,

12
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:19,459
 we've discussed an important

13
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:20,079
 proposition.

14
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:22,549
 The proposition tells us

15
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,069
 that each outer measure

16
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,989
 phi can be transformed

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,510
 into an ordinary measure.

18
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:29,510
 More concretely, we have

19
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,450
 two parts.

20
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:32,389
 The first part A tells

21
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,549
 us what the corresponding

22
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,349
 Sigma algebra A Phi

23
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:35,740
 is.

24
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:37,909
 In fact, it turns out when

25
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:39,650
 we consider all subsets

26
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:41,490
 A in X that are phi

27
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,380
 measurable, we get a Sigma

28
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:44,049
 algebra.

29
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,869
 Of course, you know this

30
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,209
 is the first ingredient we

31
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,150
 need for an ordinary measure.

32
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,840
 And exactly this one we call

33
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:53,319
 mu in part B.

34
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,799
 Now the domain of mu is given

35
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,459
 by our new Sigma algebra.

36
00:00:57,569 --> 00:00:59,060
 And the definition is given

37
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:00,639
 by the outer measure Phi.

38
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,169
 In other words, Mu of

39
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,069
 A is given by Phi of

40
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,400
 A.

41
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,599
 And then the claim is this

42
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,389
 is now a normal measure.

43
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:10,540
 OK.

44
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,029
 There you see this is a nice

45
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,610
 proposition we already

46
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,199
 introduced in part one.

47
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,550
 Therefore, now in this part

48
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:19,120
 I want to give you the ideas

49
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:19,959
 for the proof.

50
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:21,930
 This means that for the first

51
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,750
 part, we have to verify all

52
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,129
 the properties of a Sigma

53
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:25,800
 algebra.

54
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:28,050
 These are essentially three

55
00:01:28,059 --> 00:01:28,760
 things.

56
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:30,430
 First, the empty

57
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,279
 set and X should be in

58
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,110
 a phi.

59
00:01:33,809 --> 00:01:35,230
 Then the collection of sets

60
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,699
 should be closed under the

61
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:38,500
 complement and

62
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,050
 closed under countable

63
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:40,900
 unions.

64
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,959
 Hence, I would suggest we

65
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,529
 start with the simplest one

66
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,160
 checking if the empty set

67
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:47,279
 is in a Phi.

68
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,629
 So by definition, this means

69
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:51,400
 is the empty set phi

70
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,300
 measurable.

71
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,190
 So I think this is a good

72
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,180
 point, refreshing your memory.

73
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,150
 What phi measurable actually

74
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,099
 means a subset

75
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,519
 A is called phi

76
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:02,370
 measurable.

77
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:03,839
 If it fulfills the following

78
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:05,610
 relation, namely

79
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,559
 if a decomposes every

80
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:09,300
 other set Q into two

81
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:11,130
 parts such that we have this

82
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:12,589
 additive for Phi.

83
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,729
 Now, in the case that A is

84
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,360
 the empty set, we see this

85
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,570
 relation immediately

86
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:19,759
 because the first part is

87
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,210
 just the empty set again.

88
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,009
 And the second part is just

89
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,619
 Q.

90
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,580
 Of course, you see these

91
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:27,050
 intersections are not hard

92
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:27,520
 at all.

93
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,190
 And then we just need the

94
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,869
 fact that an outer measure

95
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,830
 sends the empty set to zero.

96
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,210
 Hence, the whole first part

97
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,419
 is just zero.

98
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:38,000
 And the relation holds

99
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:40,460
 and there you see one property

100
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,850
 for the Sigma algebra is

101
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,190
 already satisfied.

102
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,229
 Then the next question would

103
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,970
 be, can we do the same for

104
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:48,350
 the whole space X?

105
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:50,839
 So again, we have the question

106
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,839
 is the whole space X phi

107
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,679
 measurable.

108
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,660
 And to answer that we have

109
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:57,080
 to take the relation again

110
00:02:57,089 --> 00:02:58,520
 for every set Q.

111
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:00,360
 But now we put in X

112
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,429
 and there you see this looks

113
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,009
 very similarly because the

114
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,669
 complement of the whole space

115
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:07,270
 is of course the empty set

116
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:07,669
 again.

117
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,300
 So you see this is exactly

118
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:11,470
 the same as before.

119
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,619
 Just the two terms in the

120
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,429
 sum have switched roles.

121
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:16,910
 Hence, we can also conclude

122
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,860
 X is phi measurable.

123
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:19,880
 OK.

124
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:21,169
 With this, let's go to the

125
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:22,770
 next property of a Sigma

126
00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:24,729
 algebra, namely the

127
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,070
 question is, is the whole

128
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,940
 collection of subsets closed

129
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:29,000
 under complements.

130
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:31,169
 Hence, we start with one

131
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:33,009
 subset A that is phi

132
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,869
 measurable.

133
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,380
 Then in the end of course,

134
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:37,729
 we want to conclude that

135
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,490
 the complement of A lies

136
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,830
 also in a phi

137
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:43,289
 indeed how this proof works.

138
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,490
 You might have already seen

139
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,009
 above when we considered the

140
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,889
 empty set.

141
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,449
 And the complement X

142
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:50,699
 of course, we need to do

143
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,300
 it in a similar way because

144
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:53,919
 we only have this relation

145
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:55,639
 to work with here.

146
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:56,970
 Please always keep in mind

147
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:58,550
 I don't write it down this

148
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:00,000
 relation holds for every

149
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,970
 subset Q OK.

150
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:02,940
 Then let's do what we have

151
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:03,720
 done above.

152
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:05,389
 Let's exchange the two terms

153
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:06,119
 in the sum.

154
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,639
 In fact, this is almost what

155
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,300
 we want to have for the relation

156
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:11,199
 of AC.

157
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,149
 In the first part, we already

158
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,130
 have AC.

159
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,479
 And in the second part, we

160
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,119
 need the complement of AC.

161
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,988
 However, this is already

162
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,559
 given simply because the

163
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,079
 complement of the complement

164
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,559
 is the original set again.

165
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,649
 OK.

166
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,739
 Now here when you look at

167
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,890
 the left hand side and the

168
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,609
 right hand side, you see

169
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:30,290
 this is exactly the definition

170
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:32,160
 for ac being phi

171
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,010
 measurable.

172
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,000
 Hence, we see the second

173
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,410
 part for the Sigma algebra

174
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,809
 is also fulfilled.

175
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,010
 So only the hardest one

176
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:41,149
 remains to show.

177
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:43,600
 And here is as you can see

178
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:45,119
 the property that the Sigma

179
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,750
 algebra is close under

180
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,260
 countable unions.

181
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,790
 And we know this is related

182
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:52,440
 to the Sigma additive of

183
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,529
 the corresponding measure

184
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,049
 mu.

185
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,899
 Therefore, both things in

186
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,299
 the proof will go hand in

187
00:04:57,309 --> 00:04:57,829
 hand.

188
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,029
 However, before we do this,

189
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,480
 we first should show that

190
00:05:01,489 --> 00:05:03,100
 our A phi is

191
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:04,540
 indeed closed under a

192
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:05,750
 finite union,

193
00:05:06,429 --> 00:05:08,070
 which means we have to consider

194
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,970
 two sets.

195
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,809
 So we choose a one and a

196
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,440
 two from our A Phi.

197
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:14,079
 And then we show that the

198
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:15,929
 union of both sets lies

199
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,209
 also in a phi

200
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,529
 as before.

201
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,989
 This simply means we have

202
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,440
 to show that this property

203
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,230
 here holds for every set

204
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:23,769
 Q.

205
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:26,230
 Therefore, we already know

206
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:27,480
 our goal here.

207
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,640
 So let's put this to the

208
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:30,019
 bottom.

209
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,880
 Then here, please

210
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,390
 also recall it's

211
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,720
 sufficient by the definition

212
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,380
 of an outer measure to show

213
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,920
 the one inequality here.

214
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:38,920
 OK.

215
00:05:38,929 --> 00:05:40,480
 Then I would say let's start

216
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:41,679
 bringing the two properties

217
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,519
 for a one and a two together.

218
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,440
 First, let's apply it

219
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,549
 to a one.

220
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,489
 Then in order to bring a

221
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,359
 two in, let's call the second

222
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:52,279
 part here Q tilde.

223
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,179
 Hence, there, we now can

224
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,739
 apply the property for A

225
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,299
 two.

226
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,130
 But now instead of Q for

227
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,079
 Q tilde, which means we

228
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:02,519
 don't change the first part.

229
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,760
 But then we have two more

230
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,420
 terms which look

231
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:07,200
 like Phi of Q tilde

232
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,820
 intersected with a two

233
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,720
 plus the same with the

234
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,399
 complement.

235
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:13,929
 However, remember in

236
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,660
 the end, we only want two

237
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,410
 terms.

238
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,920
 Hence the overall idea now

239
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:20,279
 is that we put the first

240
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,980
 two terms here together.

241
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:24,380
 And in fact, we are allowed

242
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,089
 to do this using the Sigma

243
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,940
 sub additive of the

244
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,000
 outer measure Phi.

245
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,399
 However, this now means

246
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,119
 we get an inequality in

247
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:35,649
 this is simply the sub in

248
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,899
 subadditivity.

249
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:38,809
 And the rest of the property

250
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,079
 tells us that instead of

251
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:41,739
 the plus we have a union

252
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,059
 inside of Phi,

253
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,260
 OK.

254
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:46,049
 Here you can see our result,

255
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:47,619
 we have two terms for Phi.

256
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,299
 Now in the one, we

257
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,040
 find a one and a two

258
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,529
 and in the other one, we

259
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,059
 find the complement of both

260
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,670
 sets.

261
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,660
 So it seems like this is

262
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,179
 almost the thing we

263
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:58,739
 want.

264
00:06:59,130 --> 00:06:59,820
 Indeed.

265
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:01,269
 The second part we immediately

266
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,850
 recognize as the correct

267
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:04,760
 one simply because Q

268
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:06,320
 tilde was defined as

269
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:08,190
 Q intersected with a

270
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,579
 one complement.

271
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,619
 In other words, we can write

272
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,570
 it like this.

273
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:14,619
 And then when we pull out

274
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,260
 the complement, we find the

275
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,799
 union, OK?

276
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:18,559
 Very good.

277
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,179
 This is exactly the term

278
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:20,880
 we wanted.

279
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:22,850
 Now looking at the first

280
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,779
 part, it looks more complicated.

281
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,799
 However, we can also transform

282
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:27,779
 it to this.

283
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:30,049
 And maybe we just verify

284
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:31,959
 this with a Venn diagram.

285
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,980
 This works because we have

286
00:07:33,989 --> 00:07:35,820
 exactly three sets involved

287
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:37,809
 Q A one and A two.

288
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:38,890
 OK.

289
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:40,420
 Then let's start with Q

290
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:41,779
 intersected A one.

291
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,209
 This intersection you see

292
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,720
 we simply find here

293
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:48,390
 and now the other intersection

294
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,910
 is an intersection with three

295
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,519
 sets.

296
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,369
 First we have Q

297
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,149
 then a one complement and

298
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,950
 then a two and

299
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,679
 then it's not hard to see

300
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,190
 that this is exactly this

301
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,350
 small part here.

302
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:01,549
 OK.

303
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:03,200
 And then you see this Venn

304
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:05,200
 diagram explains exactly

305
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:06,700
 this intersection here.

306
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,109
 Hence the proof of the unit

307
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,790
 with two sets is indeed

308
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:11,549
 finished.

309
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,829
 The union A one with a

310
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,790
 two is also in a

311
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:16,309
 phi.

312
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:17,609
 OK.

313
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:18,869
 Then we can go to the next

314
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,299
 part where we have to consider

315
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:22,049
 countably many sets.

316
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:23,899
 Hence here we need the whole

317
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,529
 sequence of subsets A

318
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,299
 one A two and so on.

319
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,149
 They all should come from

320
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,049
 a Phi.

321
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,720
 And then the question is,

322
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,200
 is the union from J is

323
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,369
 equal to one to

324
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,890
 infinity or it's an

325
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,460
 element in a phi

326
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,630
 for this, we want to find

327
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,849
 a positive answer.

328
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:43,609
 Hence, for the rest of the

329
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:45,010
 proof, it might be helpful

330
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,390
 to give this union a shorter

331
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,900
 name.

332
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:48,549
 So let's simply call it a.

333
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,669
 Now, I can tell you instead

334
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,369
 of taking an arbitrary sequence

335
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,090
 of sets here, we can take

336
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:55,489
 a pairwise disjoint one.

337
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,390
 This is possible because

338
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,570
 we have already proven the

339
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,030
 closeness with respect to

340
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,960
 the normal union and also

341
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:03,330
 the closeness with respect

342
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,299
 to the complement.

343
00:09:04,869 --> 00:09:05,849
 Therefore, we can simply

344
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:06,640
 do this.

345
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,940
 But it also has the big

346
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,520
 advantage that we immediately

347
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,190
 get this sigma additivity

348
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,469
 for the measure mu in the

349
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:12,869
 end.

350
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:14,820
 Because in order to show

351
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,580
 this, you know, we need to

352
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,979
 consider pairwise disjoint

353
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:18,409
 sets.

354
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,859
 Hence, in summary, it's indeed

355
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:22,390
 helpful to do the proof like

356
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:22,840
 this.

357
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,960
 Of course, here at the start

358
00:09:24,969 --> 00:09:26,299
 of the proof, it might not

359
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:27,950
 surprise you that again,

360
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,280
 we use the property, the

361
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:30,630
 outer measure gives us.

362
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,979
 However, here I want to put

363
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,599
 in a special set

364
00:09:34,609 --> 00:09:36,500
 Q first, we could

365
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,320
 have any set.

366
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,099
 So let's simply call it Q

367
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:39,690
 hat.

368
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,619
 And then we put in the

369
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,169
 intersection of a

370
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:44,830
 one in the union with a

371
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,260
 two.

372
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,719
 And here please keep in mind

373
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:49,489
 a one and A two are

374
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,280
 disjoint.

375
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,059
 This fact will help us on

376
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,380
 the right hand side when

377
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,940
 we put in the same set for

378
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:55,669
 the set Q.

379
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:57,599
 For example, in the first

380
00:09:57,609 --> 00:09:59,190
 part, you see the intersection

381
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,049
 with a one here will completely

382
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,359
 cancel out A two.

383
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:04,460
 Therefore, the first part

384
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:06,359
 is just Q head intersected

385
00:10:06,369 --> 00:10:07,239
 with a one.

386
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,090
 Then in the second part,

387
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:10,729
 because we have the complement

388
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:12,619
 of a one, this will completely

389
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,330
 cancel out a one itself.

390
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:16,869
 So we simply have phi of

391
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,590
 Q head intersected with A

392
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:19,010
 two.

393
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,190
 OK.

394
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,549
 So you should see this is

395
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,440
 a nice trick to get the union

396
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,770
 on the left hand side.

397
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,219
 And the sum on the right

398
00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:28,070
 hand side, hence, the

399
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,520
 next step would be to do

400
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,830
 an induction to get

401
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,669
 finitely many sets in.

402
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:35,260
 So the induction shows we

403
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,969
 have Phi of Q hat

404
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,869
 intersected with a

405
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,299
 finite union.

406
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,320
 So you see this whole thing

407
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,020
 here is simply the left hand

408
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,799
 side and then the

409
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:47,330
 right hand side is given

410
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,270
 by a sum.

411
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,650
 Of course, also from J is

412
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:52,309
 equal to one to N.

413
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,239
 And inside we have Phi of

414
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,099
 Q hat intersected with

415
00:10:57,109 --> 00:10:57,789
 AJ.

416
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:58,820
 OK.

417
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,380
 So this is a nice result

418
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,020
 which holds for every N.

419
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,450
 So we should give it a name,

420
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,849
 let's call it star.

421
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:07,510
 Now let's go one step back

422
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,320
 and recall what we already

423
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:09,799
 know.

424
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:11,919
 Namely, we know that this

425
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:13,799
 unit here is by our proof

426
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:14,770
 above all

427
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,760
 element in A five.

428
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,750
 So we don't have the infinite

429
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,619
 union yet in a Phi but

430
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,880
 we are getting closer

431
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:23,859
 because when we know that

432
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:25,770
 this is an API we can use

433
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,750
 the property as always the

434
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,299
 proper for the outer measure.

435
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,760
 So this works as before.

436
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,390
 But now instead of Q, we

437
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,090
 use Q hat and instead of

438
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:36,840
 our A, we have here the union

439
00:11:36,849 --> 00:11:37,690
 of the AJ.

440
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:39,700
 Now, for the first part,

441
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,380
 you should see we can use

442
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,109
 our star property to

443
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,580
 rewrite that as a sum.

444
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,909
 So you see with each step,

445
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,000
 we are getting closer and

446
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,630
 closer to the Sigma 

447
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:49,950
 additivity.

448
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:50,739
 OK.

449
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,039
 Then for the second part

450
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:53,669
 here we use something we

451
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,049
 didn't use before.

452
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:56,650
 But where we know it holds

453
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:57,710
 for an outer measure,

454
00:11:58,169 --> 00:11:59,669
 indeed, it's the second

455
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,989
 property and outer measure

456
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,799
 has the monotonicity.

457
00:12:03,229 --> 00:12:04,950
 We can use that here because

458
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,159
 when we increase the index

459
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:07,989
 and here this whole set

460
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,650
 here would get smaller.

461
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,750
 Therefore, we can also do

462
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,070
 it for end to infinity,

463
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,950
 then we have the infinite

464
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,669
 union, which we simply called

465
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,030
 A.

466
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,270
 So the second part is greater

467
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,960
 or equal than Phi of

468
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:22,770
 Q hat intersected with

469
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,349
 AC OK.

470
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:26,299
 With this, we now have something

471
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:27,799
 where there is no index and

472
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:29,369
 in a union anymore.

473
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,229
 Indeed, we have here an

474
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:33,109
 inequality that holds for

475
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,390
 all natural numbers.

476
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,200
 And therefore this

477
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,150
 inequality also holds the

478
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,710
 limit and to infinity.

479
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,739
 Hence, Phi of Q head

480
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,369
 is create or equal.

481
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,469
 Then the infinite sum

482
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:47,109
 of Phi of Q hat

483
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:48,669
 intersected with AJ

484
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,070
 plus the second term Phi

485
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,989
 of Q hat intersected with

486
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,580
 AC.

487
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,650
 So here you see we have an

488
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:57,510
 infinite sum and remember

489
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,169
 we want to show the Sigma

490
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,880
 additivity but

491
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,520
 also don't forget for

492
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,429
 Phi, we already have the

493
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,820
 Sigma subadditivityv.

494
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:08,469
 And indeed, this is what

495
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,390
 we should use here, which

496
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,190
 means we get an inequality

497
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,770
 when we substitute the infinite

498
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,250
 sum with an infinite union

499
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,669
 inside Phi.

500
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,859
 However, this infinite union

501
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:20,109
 already has a name.

502
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:21,820
 We called it A at the beginning.

503
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,039
 And in fact, with this last

504
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:25,799
 step, the inequality now

505
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:27,719
 looks very short and

506
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:29,280
 we can make it even shorter

507
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:30,880
 by using the Sigma sub edit

508
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,809
 tity again, which

509
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,799
 means the sum here now

510
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:36,239
 goes to a union inside

511
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:36,840
 Phi.

512
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:38,799
 However, because we have

513
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:40,320
 a and the complement of a,

514
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:42,280
 just Q hat remains.

515
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,679
 And now, maybe surprisingly,

516
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,190
 on the right hand side, we

517
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,500
 have the same thing as on

518
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,359
 the left hand side, which

519
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:51,190
 means for all the inequalities

520
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,159
 here that we actually have

521
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:55,090
 equalities in

522
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:56,760
 particular we get because

523
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,599
 this whole equality holds

524
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:00,030
 no matter which subset Q

525
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,000
 had we choose the defining

526
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,000
 property for a being an

527
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:04,739
 A Phi.

528
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:07,000
 Please recall this was our

529
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,890
 goal all along because

530
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,849
 it shows now that a Phi

531
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:12,760
 is indeed a Sigma algebra.

532
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,150
 In fact, we have also proven

533
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,840
 part B in the proposition

534
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,719
 because this equality

535
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,520
 gives us the sigma additivity

536
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,359
 for our measure.

537
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,719
 You see this because Q hat

538
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,440
 can be any set in

539
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,070
 particular, it could be a

540
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,849
 itself and then we

541
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:30,820
 have measure of the infinite

542
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,650
 union is equal to the

543
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:33,559
 infinite sum.

544
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:34,599
 OK.

545
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:36,520
 So here you see we have everything

546
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,950
 this closes the proof.

547
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,599
 Now with this nice proven

548
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:42,549
 result, we are way closer

549
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,020
 to be able to prove the

550
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,340
 famous Carathéodory's

551
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,150
 extension theorem.

552
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:49,539
 And maybe we do this

553
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:50,780
 in the next video.

554
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:52,780
 Therefore, I hope I see you

555
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:54,260
 there and have a nice day.

556
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:55,070
 Bye.
