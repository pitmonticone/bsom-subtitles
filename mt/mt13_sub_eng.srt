00:00:00,479 --> 00:00:02,269
 Hello and welcome to a

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:03,900
 new video in the topic of

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,010
 measure theory.

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,409
 First, let me thank all the

5
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,170
 nice people that support

6
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,890
 this channel on steady.

7
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:13,649
 And today's topic is Lebesgue-Stieltjes

8
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:15,329
 measures.

9
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,389
 It sounds like something

10
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:19,090
 different than a normal measure,

11
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:21,110
 but it's not, it's just a

12
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,840
 way to construct an

13
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,969
 ordinary measure.

14
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,829
 And in this way, we can start,

15
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,450
 we will now construct a

16
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:29,020
 measure.

17
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:31,569
 The only thing we need here

18
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:33,069
 is a monotonically

19
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,590
 increasing function

20
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:36,549
 defined on the real number

21
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,020
 line.

22
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,979
 And when I say monotonically

23
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,790
 increasing, I mean

24
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,990
 non-decreasing.

25
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,580
 In other words, a constant

26
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,150
 function is also

27
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:47,889
 monotonically increasing.

28
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:50,159
 The best way to see that

29
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:51,990
 is of course to draw a short

30
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:53,240
 graph of such a function.

31
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,500
 So maybe the function is

32
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:57,200
 first increasing here

33
00:00:58,009 --> 00:00:59,880
 then at it is constant

34
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:03,259
 and maybe, then we have a

35
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,029
 jump point at this point.

36
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,419
 So no value here, the value

37
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,150
 is here then still the

38
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,989
 constant

39
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:12,550
 and maybe after this, it's

40
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:13,910
 still increasing and then

41
00:01:13,919 --> 00:01:15,839
 comes the next jump point.

42
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,300
 So here's the point and then

43
00:01:19,309 --> 00:01:20,910
 it goes to an

44
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:22,290
 increasing function till

45
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,029
 here and then maybe it's

46
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,309
 constant after that.

47
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,209
 OK.

48
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,129
 So this is a typical example

49
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:30,290
 of a graph of a

50
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,930
 monotonically increasing

51
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,459
 function.

52
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:35,379
 In particular, it's allowed

53
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:36,660
 that the function is

54
00:01:36,669 --> 00:01:38,279
 constant at some

55
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:38,919
 parts.

56
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,279
 And there could be also points

57
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,470
 where the function is non

58
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,459
 continuous.

59
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,099
 So where we have jumps,

60
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:46,910
 but of course, the jumps

61
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:48,540
 has to go upwards.

62
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:51,430
 Now, with the help of such

63
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,069
 a function, we want to

64
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,699
 measure the length of

65
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:55,510
 intervals.

66
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,629
 First, I want to calculate

67
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:59,470
 intervals of the form A

68
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,389
 B where A is

69
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,989
 included but B is

70
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,870
 excluded

71
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,510
 for better visualization,

72
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,070
 I can put that here in the

73
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,690
 picture.

74
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,589
 So here's A and

75
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,809
 there's our B,

76
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,559
 obviously, the normal notion

77
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,130
 of the length would be just

78
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:18,850
 B minus

79
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,309
 A.

80
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:22,119
 But here I want that F

81
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,039
 as a function scales

82
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,720
 the length of this interval,

83
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:27,639
 this means that the length

84
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:29,619
 should be longer where the

85
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,929
 increase of the function

86
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,179
 is stronger.

87
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,669
 Therefore, we have to look

88
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,449
 what the function does with

89
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,190
 the interval.

90
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,110
 So we look at the

91
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:40,729
 image of the

92
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,160
 interval under the

93
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:43,229
 function F

94
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,940
 in the picture.

95
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:46,419
 This would roughly look like

96
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:46,669
 this.

97
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:48,020
 So we have a point

98
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:50,100
 FB here

99
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,320
 and F of A

100
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,029
 here

101
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,839
 scaling the length of this

102
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,009
 interval of the function

103
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,419
 F.

104
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:00,410
 Now just means we look at

105
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:01,830
 the Y axis here,

106
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,000
 which means the length of

107
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:05,490
 this interval which is

108
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,220
 just F of

109
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,850
 B minus

110
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,110
 F of A.

111
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:12,630
 OK.

112
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,789
 Now, I hope you immediately

113
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,789
 recognized a mistake here.

114
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,589
 You see B is not

115
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,259
 a point in our interval.

116
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,479
 Therefore, it would be wrong

117
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,919
 to use this point.

118
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:26,729
 So the image of B we

119
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,559
 should rather use this point

120
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,179
 here.

121
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,389
 This one is the correct point

122
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,710
 that describes the right

123
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,300
 hand bound of the

124
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:35,539
 image of A B.

125
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,039
 Therefore, on the Y axis,

126
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,600
 we also have this point

127
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,089
 here.

128
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,179
 The important one

129
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:43,160
 and I would call it

130
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:44,960
 FB minus in a

131
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,070
 short notation.

132
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,589
 Therefore, I would also include

133
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,020
 the point here on the right

134
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,699
 for calculating the length

135
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,580
 of the interval.

136
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,550
 Well, now you should see

137
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,039
 we have the same problem

138
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:57,509
 here.

139
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,729
 We have the same problem

140
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,149
 on the left hand side with

141
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,820
 the point A, you

142
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,720
 see A is included in

143
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:04,610
 our interval.

144
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,830
 And therefore, we should

145
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:07,309
 include this full

146
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,979
 jump in our calculation of

147
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,649
 the length of this interval.

148
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,360
 On the right hand side, we

149
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:13,910
 ignored the full jump because

150
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,300
 B was not in the interval,

151
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:17,048
 but now A is in the

152
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:17,790
 interval.

153
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,750
 And therefore we should add

154
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,670
 the jump to our calculation.

155
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,619
 You see this immediately,

156
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,619
 if we change this point

157
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,420
 maybe to the middle here,

158
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:29,359
 then we would change the

159
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,450
 whole calculation of the

160
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:32,000
 length, but we wouldn't

161
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,730
 change the total jump.

162
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,309
 Hence, the only meaningful

163
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,049
 way to choose a point here

164
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:39,619
 would be to choose the point

165
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,369
 the value at the bottom here.

166
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,100
 And as before, I also would

167
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:46,559
 call this in short

168
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,859
 by fa

169
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:49,739
 minus and then we

170
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,600
 include the minus sign here

171
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:52,399
 as well.

172
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:54,880
 Now this thing is now our

173
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,600
 new notion of the length

174
00:04:56,609 --> 00:04:57,559
 of an interval.

175
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,380
 And of course, I should give

176
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,850
 it a name and we call it

177
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,790
 mu with index

178
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:04,109
 F of this

179
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:04,799
 interval.

180
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,250
 And to be more precise, I

181
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,929
 also add the definition

182
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,459
 of our FB

183
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,109
 minus or FA

184
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:12,859
 minus.

185
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:16,010
 As you can see, this is nothing

186
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,970
 else than a left limit.

187
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,429
 So we get closer and

188
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,890
 closer coming from the

189
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:21,489
 left.

190
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:23,910
 Therefore, we can write this

191
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,609
 as an epsilon that goes to

192
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:27,500
 zero plus, which means

193
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,119
 it's an epsilon greater than

194
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,000
 zero that goes to zero.

195
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:33,079
 And then we subtract it

196
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:34,140
 from A

197
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,510
 and then you see we get back

198
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,309
 the points we have seen in

199
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,350
 our drawing here.

200
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,799
 And at this point, you are

201
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:45,390
 allowed to ask what

202
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,790
 happens if I come from the

203
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,619
 right hand side instead of

204
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,670
 the left hand side.

205
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,739
 And then what you get is

206
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,549
 an alternative way to

207
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:54,369
 write this down.

208
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,970
 So we have FB

209
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,970
 plus

210
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,950
 minus FA

211
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,850
 plus where the plus

212
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:02,579
 now means the right hand

213
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:03,250
 limit.

214
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,399
 Now, if you go back to our

215
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,359
 graph, then you see,

216
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,720
 now we describe

217
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,459
 another interval, not

218
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,239
 this one because

219
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,920
 now we ignore this jump,

220
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:17,730
 but we add this jump on the

221
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:19,480
 right, this means that

222
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:21,029
 we exactly change the

223
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,010
 boundaries here.

224
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:23,959
 Now we measure an interval

225
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,559
 where A is not

226
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,420
 included.

227
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,019
 But B is

228
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:31,630
 hence, if you want to work

229
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,549
 with these intervals, then

230
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,880
 you have to consider the

231
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,950
 right hand limit.

232
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,269
 I personally want to work

233
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,339
 with these intervals.

234
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,130
 And therefore, we don't need

235
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,309
 the alternative here.

236
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,739
 Nevertheless, it's very important

237
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,450
 to note that if you look

238
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:48,799
 at the points where the function

239
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,619
 F is not continuous,

240
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:52,510
 then it does not matter at

241
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,359
 all where the value

242
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:55,850
 of the function at this point

243
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:57,420
 is it only

244
00:06:57,429 --> 00:06:58,890
 matters what the limit from

245
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:00,290
 the left hand side is.

246
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:01,450
 And what the limit from the

247
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:02,579
 right hand side is

248
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,970
 because these two points

249
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,730
 describe how large the

250
00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:07,529
 jump is.

251
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,290
 OK.

252
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:10,679
 I said before, I want to

253
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,320
 work with these intervals

254
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:14,160
 here because we know

255
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,119
 from another video that

256
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,950
 they form a so called semiring.

257
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:19,809
 This is what I

258
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,630
 explained to you in the video

259
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,279
 about Carathéodory's

260
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,519
 extension theory.

261
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,109
 And now we can apply this

262
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,899
 theorem to conclude

263
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,709
 that we can extend this

264
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,119
 definition to a

265
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,869
 measure defined on the

266
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,829
 full Borel sigma algebra

267
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,510
 of R.

268
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:38,959
 This means there is

269
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,839
 exactly one measure

270
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,209
 defined on

271
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,380
 B(R)

272
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,470
 to 0 infinity

273
00:07:48,549 --> 00:07:49,929
 with the property

274
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,609
 that we have here.

275
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,190
 So maybe let's call this

276
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,119
 property here star and then

277
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,029
 I can write star here.

278
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,940
 Now it's useful to call this

279
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,239
 uniquely given measure

280
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,880
 again by

281
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,869
 mu F.

282
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:07,670
 And if we construct a measure

283
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,579
 in this way, we call it a

284
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,440
 Lebesgue Stieltjes measure.

285
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,600
 And to be more concrete,

286
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,570
 you call it the Lebesgue

287
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,399
 Stieltjes measure for the

288
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,549
 function F

289
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,279
 here, you recognize how

290
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,070
 strong Carathéodory's

291
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:25,299
 extension theorem really

292
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:25,779
 is.

293
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,000
 You only have to find the

294
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,059
 measure for the

295
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,869
 intervals and then you get

296
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,719
 exactly one measure

297
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:34,440
 for all Borel sets out,

298
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,109
 OK.

299
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:37,558
 Now, you know how this

300
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,808
 construction works.

301
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,359
 And I would suggest that

302
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:42,320
 we now look at examples.

303
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,879
 An example means of course,

304
00:08:44,888 --> 00:08:46,679
 we choose a monotonically

305
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:48,528
 increasing function capital

306
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:50,239
 F and then we look

307
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:51,958
 what is the associated Lebesgue Stieltjes

308
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:53,078
 measure.

309
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:54,409
 OK.

310
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:55,690
 Maybe the easiest

311
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,590
 example is the Lebesgue

312
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,599
 measure itself.

313
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,169
 For this, we choose

314
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:01,369
 simply the

315
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,190
 identity.

316
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,760
 So the function FX

317
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,690
 equals to X, then

318
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,049
 we don't change the

319
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:08,840
 normal measuring of

320
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,260
 lengths of intervals.

321
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:12,049
 So we get out

322
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,109
 B minus A

323
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,210
 as before.

324
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,919
 Hence, we get out our

325
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:19,719
 ordinary Lebesgue measure.

326
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,440
 Another example of a

327
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,520
 very easy

328
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,229
 monotonically increasing

329
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:27,080
 function would be a constant

330
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:27,640
 function.

331
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,809
 So let's choose FX is

332
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,969
 equal to one

333
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:32,849
 everywhere.

334
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:34,969
 Obviously, in this case,

335
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:36,590
 measuring the length of

336
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:38,289
 intervals is very boring

337
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:40,969
 because we subtract right

338
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:41,780
 from left.

339
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,500
 So we have here everywhere

340
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,400
 zero.

341
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,320
 Hence this is not so

342
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,159
 surprising we get out

343
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:49,440
 our zero measure.

344
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:50,640
 OK.

345
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,580
 Maybe more interesting would

346
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,039
 be the case where we have

347
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:55,719
 two values for the function.

348
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:57,919
 So constant function, with

349
00:09:57,929 --> 00:09:59,919
 the exception of one jump,

350
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,150
 for example, we could choose

351
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,059
 zero if X is

352
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,010
 less than zero and

353
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,780
 one if X is

354
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:09,640
 greater or equal than zero.

355
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,869
 And please remember it does

356
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,659
 not matter where the equality

357
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:14,630
 sign is here.

358
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,159
 The measure just doesn't

359
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:17,359
 care about this.

360
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:19,020
 The measure can't see this

361
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,950
 point there.

362
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,530
 Now, obviously, we have the

363
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,359
 same result as before.

364
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:26,169
 For all intervals that

365
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:27,609
 lie completely to the left

366
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:28,280
 of zero.

367
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:29,590
 Or completely to the right

368
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:30,320
 of zero.

369
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,500
 And we get out again, the

370
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,590
 measure zero.

371
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:35,169
 Hence, the interesting

372
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:36,809
 cases would be where

373
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,359
 zero is inside the

374
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:39,080
 interval.

375
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,460
 For example, let's look at

376
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:42,780
 the interval minus

377
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:44,200
 epsilon till

378
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,039
 epsilon.

379
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:46,330
 Of course, where epsilon

380
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,130
 is a positive number.

381
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:50,989
 Now, what do we get on the

382
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,979
 right hand side, we have

383
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:53,750
 one on left, we have zero.

384
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,219
 So we have one minus

385
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:55,760
 zero.

386
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:57,359
 So we get out one.

387
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,960
 And please note this holds

388
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:01,299
 for all epsilon,

389
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,380
 we already know a measure

390
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,099
 that does this and this

391
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:06,789
 is the Dirac measure at

392
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,369
 zero.

393
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,049
 Now, by the uniqueness result,

394
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:11,380
 we know that the

395
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,250
 extension has to be this

396
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,020
 Dirac measure.

397
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,429
 So you see we can use this

398
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,229
 strong result very often.

399
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:20,750
 Now for the end of the video,

400
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,719
 let's look at a very general

401
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:23,479
 example.

402
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,130
 Therefore, let's choose a

403
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,770
 general monotonically

404
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,479
 increasing function F

405
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,200
 but in addition, it should

406
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,809
 also be continuously

407
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,760
 differentiable both

408
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,559
 things together.

409
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,840
 Now means that the

410
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:37,200
 derivative is

411
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,650
 continuous and

412
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:40,650
 also has values in the

413
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:41,909
 non-negative

414
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:42,679
 numbers.

415
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:46,080
 On the other hand, F

416
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,450
 itself is of course

417
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,369
 continuous.

418
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,250
 Therefore, there are no jumps.

419
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:52,210
 This means that we don't

420
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:53,530
 have the problem with the

421
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:54,500
 left hand limit.

422
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,479
 And the right hand limit

423
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:57,210
 from before, for this

424
00:11:57,219 --> 00:11:58,450
 continuous function, we can

425
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,450
 just use the values of the

426
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,049
 function.

427
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:03,640
 This means the length of

428
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,219
 the interval is nothing

429
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:06,190
 more than

430
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,030
 FB minus

431
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:08,979
 FA.

432
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,280
 Now, if you learn calculus,

433
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:13,979
 you should immediately recognize

434
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:14,989
 this one here,

435
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,960
 namely, here you can

436
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,700
 apply the fundamental

437
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,309
 theorem of calculus

438
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:22,840
 which tells you this is

439
00:12:22,849 --> 00:12:24,440
 the integral of the

440
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,340
 derivative of

441
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,299
 F dX where

442
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:30,260
 dx just denotes the normal

443
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,200
 Lebesgue measure here.

444
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:32,880
 OK.

445
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,380
 And this is all we need

446
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,979
 because you would believe

447
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,929
 me that we can define a

448
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,979
 new measure.

449
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,880
 So for each Borel set

450
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,739
 A, we define the

451
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,479
 measure as this

452
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:45,400
 integral.

453
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:45,690
 Yeah.

454
00:12:45,729 --> 00:12:47,520
 So we send the Borel

455
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,140
 set to this number

456
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,580
 here.

457
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,900
 This defines us a measure

458
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:53,619
 on the Borel Sigma algebra

459
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,200
 of R.

460
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:56,539
 And now we apply the uniqueness

461
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:58,419
 result of Carathéodory's

462
00:12:58,429 --> 00:12:59,859
 extension theorem.

463
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,780
 And then we get out that

464
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:03,700
 our measure mu F

465
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,520
 looks exactly like this

466
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:05,859
 one.

467
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,419
 We know it looks like this

468
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:10,229
 for all intervals

469
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:11,659
 and therefore it should also

470
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:13,479
 look like this for each Borel

471
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:14,109
 set.

472
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:15,419
 OK.

473
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,880
 Here you see a very general

474
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,179
 result for such

475
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,719
 Lebesgue Stieltjes measures.

476
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:21,859
 And this part here in the

477
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:23,460
 integral is then often

478
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,869
 called a density

479
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,559
 function.

480
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,349
 However, that's a thing we

481
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:29,830
 could discuss in another

482
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,070
 video later

483
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,280
 here.

484
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:33,869
 I really hope you learned

485
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,789
 something today and that

486
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,030
 you can apply these

487
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,390
 results in other

488
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,510
 applications.

489
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,140
 If you see a monotonically

490
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,479
 increasing function,

491
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,840
 now you can

492
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:46,289
 construct the Lebesgue Stieltjes

493
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,000
 measure for this function.

494
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,429
 Well, thank you for listening

495
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,750
 and see you next time.

496
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:52,590
 Bye.
