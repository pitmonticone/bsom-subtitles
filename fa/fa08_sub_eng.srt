00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:02,210
Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,390
functional analysis.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,610
And as always, I want to

4
00:00:04,619 --> 00:00:06,090
thank all the nice people

5
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:07,780
that support my channel on

6
00:00:07,789 --> 00:00:08,920
Steady or paypal.

7
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:11,229
In today's part eight, we

8
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:12,819
introduce inner products

9
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:14,130
and Hilbert spaces.

10
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,819
You will see such an inner

11
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:18,399
product gives the space more

12
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:19,149
structure.

13
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:20,950
So maybe let's recall which

14
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:22,309
structures we already know.

15
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,040
First, we discussed

16
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:25,870
metrics and we learned

17
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:27,270
that a metric measures

18
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,700
distances in the space.

19
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,280
Afterwards, we introduced

20
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,240
norms for vector spaces.

21
00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:35,229
And there we learned that

22
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,569
a norm measures distances

23
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,250
as well, but it also

24
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:39,750
measures lengths of

25
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:40,369
vectors.

26
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:42,669
And now an inner product

27
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,990
should do even more in a

28
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,869
vector space.

29
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:47,270
Besides measuring distances

30
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:49,209
and lengths, it is also able

31
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,119
to measure angles between

32
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:51,880
two vectors.

33
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,119
So you see an inner product

34
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,020
gives you a geometry like

35
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:57,279
you naturally have it on

36
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,599
the plane or the surrounding

37
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:59,080
space.

38
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:01,349
The user notation one uses

39
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,009
for an inner product is given

40
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,319
by these brackets.

41
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,779
So what we have is one vector

42
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,349
X on the left hand side and

43
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,970
another vector Y on the right

44
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,809
hand side, a nice

45
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:13,290
visualization for this would

46
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,169
be to have the vector X on

47
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,360
the horizontal line

48
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:18,930
and the vector Y in another

49
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,349
direction as an arrow,

50
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:22,849
which means in this picture,

51
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,610
we find an angle which we

52
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,599
could call alpha.

53
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,330
For example.

54
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,629
Now the inner product should

55
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:30,160
be a multiplication of these

56
00:01:30,169 --> 00:01:31,889
two vectors where only the

57
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,279
component of Y

58
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,889
interdiction of X is

59
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,459
needed in the

60
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,050
picture.

61
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:38,400
This would mean that we have

62
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,099
here a wide angle and

63
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,900
only look at this arrow here.

64
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,709
Now, since you're good with

65
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,059
trigonometric functions,

66
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:46,419
you can easily calculate

67
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,059
the length of this yellow

68
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,580
arrow.

69
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,889
It is simply the length of

70
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,389
Y times the

71
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,900
cosine of alpha.

72
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,430
And this length now should

73
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,209
be multiplied with the length

74
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,519
of the AX.

75
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:02,209
And this formula now explains

76
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,529
what we want from an inner

77
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,169
product.

78
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,089
However, it does not define

79
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:06,769
anything yet.

80
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:07,910
It does not explain what

81
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,258
the norm should mean here

82
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:10,820
and what the angle alpha

83
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,369
is in a general vector space.

84
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:14,360
Of course, the correct logic

85
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:15,759
should be that we start with

86
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,110
an inner product, then we

87
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,630
define norm and then we

88
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,429
define the angle such that

89
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,759
we get a formula in this

90
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,149
sense.

91
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:24,490
In order to do that, we now

92
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,289
finally state the definition

93
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,720
as usual, we use the letter

94
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:30,539
F to denote either R or

95
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,490
C and then X

96
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,199
should be just an F vector

97
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:34,660
space.

98
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:36,979
Now, the inner product is

99
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,979
just a map where we use these

100
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,839
angle brackets.

101
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,520
Again, the

102
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,389
input is two vectors such

103
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,639
that the domain should be

104
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:46,029
X times X.

105
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,199
We've already discussed that

106
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,619
the outcome should be just

107
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,259
a number.

108
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,850
So is scalar in F

109
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,970
and there we already see

110
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:55,809
that if we are in the complex

111
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,309
numbers in a complex vector

112
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,699
space, this formula from

113
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,130
above can't be completely

114
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:00,529
true.

115
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,850
So let's use some quotation

116
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,619
marks to say that this was

117
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,449
just an informal explanation

118
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,240
at the beginning.

119
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,229
Nevertheless, it can still

120
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,789
guide us through the definition

121
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,110
here.

122
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,220
OK.

123
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,589
Now, such a map is called

124
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,380
an inner product.

125
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:16,360
If it fulfills three properties.

126
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,110
The first property tells

127
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:19,250
us that the inner product

128
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:20,600
should be able to measure

129
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,139
lengths.

130
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:23,770
This means that if we put

131
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:25,729
the same vector X into both

132
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,289
sides, then the

133
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,539
outcome should be a nonne

134
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,970
real number no matter if

135
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:31,949
we are in the real or the

136
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,809
complex case.

137
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,169
On the other hand, you already

138
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:36,970
know length zero should be

139
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:38,660
only possible for the zero

140
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:39,199
vector.

141
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,779
In other words, XX is

142
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,720
zero if and only if

143
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:45,100
X is the zero vector.

144
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,110
Of course, you recognize

145
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,820
this property, it's called

146
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,059
positive definite.

147
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,779
Indeed, you see it's the

148
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:53,460
same first property as we

149
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,490
had it for the norm.

150
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,630
Now, the second property

151
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,350
is about what changes when

152
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,009
we exchange the two vectors

153
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,020
in the inner product

154
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:03,130
having a picture from above

155
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:04,830
in mind, you see we still

156
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:05,960
have the same angle.

157
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,940
So it shouldn't make any

158
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:08,270
difference when we exchange

159
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,039
the two vectors.

160
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,539
So this should be

161
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,380
YNX.

162
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:16,178
However, this only makes

163
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,709
sense in the case that we

164
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,399
are in a real vector space.

165
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,200
So our F is indeed

166
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:21,678
R.

167
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:24,600
Now from complex vector space,

168
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:26,279
we've already seen that this

169
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,799
equation here can't be the

170
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,739
complete truth.

171
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:31,230
Indeed, the complex conjugation

172
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,600
has to be involved here.

173
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:34,589
Please keep in mind that

174
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,230
in the first property also,

175
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:37,970
in a complex case, we want

176
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,709
to get out a real number

177
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,029
when we put in the same vector

178
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,540
twice.

179
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,929
So therefore, if we exchange

180
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,640
it to vector here, we also

181
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:47,609
have to add a complex conjugation.

182
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:49,959
For this reason, we call

183
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,459
this property conjugate

184
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,779
symmetry or just

185
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,450
symmetry if we are in a real

186
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:54,899
case.

187
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:56,989
And now the third and last

188
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,970
property should finally be

189
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,899
the linearity.

190
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,089
The linearity makes sense.

191
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,070
If you look at the picture

192
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,720
again, if you scale

193
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,230
Y or if you add another

194
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,209
vector, then you could just

195
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,790
do the same with the outcome

196
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,910
for the formula, we then

197
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,049
need two vectors.

198
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:14,640
So let's call them why one

199
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,309
and why two and add them

200
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:18,529
the inner product should

201
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,670
be additive in the second

202
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:21,089
component, which means we

203
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,570
can pull out the addition

204
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:22,890
here.

205
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:24,429
Of course, it should also

206
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,109
be homogeneous, which means

207
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,600
we can pull out a scalar.

208
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:29,720
So let's call that scalar

209
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,359
lambda.

210
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:31,549
And then the equation looks

211
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:33,510
like this, which means

212
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,769
that on the right hand side,

213
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:36,459
we just have the multiplication

214
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,070
of two numbers in F.

215
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,190
And indeed, that's the part

216
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,640
that only works in the second

217
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:43,269
component because if you

218
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,640
want to do that in the first

219
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:46,269
component as well, you have

220
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,600
to use property two.

221
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:49,619
And that one tells you you

222
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,799
don't have any problem in

223
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:51,670
the real case.

224
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:53,239
But in the complex case,

225
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,109
you get out lambda bar

226
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:55,920
instead of lambda.

227
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,079
So please keep that in mind.

228
00:05:58,089 --> 00:05:59,880
Both sides are not the same.

229
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:02,059
And here we have chosen the

230
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,700
second part to be the linear

231
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:04,059
one.

232
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,399
I emphasize that because

233
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,950
there are other people that

234
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,359
choose the first part to

235
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,339
be the linear one.

236
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,440
Therefore, please be careful

237
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:12,720
there.

238
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,000
OK.

239
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,670
So that's the whole definition

240
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,829
of an inner product.

241
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,350
And the vector space X

242
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:20,059
together with an inner product,

243
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,940
we just call an inner product

244
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,309
space.

245
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,609
Now, an important part we've

246
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:26,269
already mentioned is that

247
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,730
in an inner product space,

248
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:29,279
we can measure lengths

249
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,329
and we can do that simply

250
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:32,929
by defining a norm.

251
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,850
And we do this by using the

252
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:36,010
formula from above.

253
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:37,989
So we set the norm of X

254
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,320
to be the square root of

255
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:40,209
the inner product

256
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,079
by using these three properties.

257
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:44,929
It's indeed easy to show

258
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,559
that this defines a norm.

259
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,910
And if we need to be careful

260
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,420
which norm we talk about,

261
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,429
we can set the inner product

262
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,510
as an index here.

263
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,809
Now, to close this video,

264
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,540
I tell you now what a Hilbert

265
00:06:57,549 --> 00:06:59,399
space is an

266
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,799
inner product space, which

267
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:02,500
means X together with an

268
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,489
inner product, it's

269
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,209
called a Hilbert space

270
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,730
if X together with the

271
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:10,619
corresponding norm is a ban

272
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,380
of space.

273
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,920
So this means we have a vector

274
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:15,339
space where we can measure

275
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,950
lengths and angles and it's

276
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,739
also a complete metric space.

277
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:20,239
OK?

278
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,149
I think that's good enough

279
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,859
for today.

280
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:23,660
I see you next time when

281
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,250
we discuss examples of Hilbert

282
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,829
spaces.

283
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,119
So have a nice day and see

284
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:28,640
you then.

285
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:29,279
Bye.
