00:00:00,479 --> 00:00:02,369
Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,509
functional analysis.

3
00:00:03,599 --> 00:00:05,280
And first many thanks to

4
00:00:05,289 --> 00:00:06,380
all the nice people that

5
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:07,769
support me on study or

6
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,489
paypal.

7
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,960
And I can also tell you that

8
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,470
now you find the PDF

9
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,350
versions of all new videos

10
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:15,600
in the description below.

11
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,180
So this is part 10 today

12
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,739
and we will still talk about

13
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,780
inner products.

14
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:23,010
In particular, I want to

15
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,590
prove the Cauchy Schwarz

16
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,430
inequality

17
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:27,319
depending where you come

18
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:27,809
from.

19
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:29,190
The equality is known by

20
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,280
different names.

21
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,700
But I stay here with the

22
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:32,598
most common one.

23
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,330
And here it is named after the

24
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,770
French mathematician Cauchy

25
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,659
and a German mathematician

26
00:00:37,669 --> 00:00:38,119
Schwarz.

27
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,569
Indeed, this inequality is

28
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,270
very important because it

29
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:44,049
holds for all inner products.

30
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,770
Therefore, let's choose an

31
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,729
F vector space X and an

32
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,529
inner product.

33
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:50,790
And we also consider the

34
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,369
corresponding norm which

35
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,459
is the square root of the

36
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,229
inner product.

37
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,650
And then with these notations,

38
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:58,119
the following inequality

39
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,020
holds, we

40
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:01,389
look at the inner product

41
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,630
X with Y.

42
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,489
And because it could be in

43
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,980
general a complex number,

44
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:07,120
we need the absolute value

45
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:07,489
here.

46
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,849
And then we can say this

47
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,819
is less or equal than the

48
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,419
two norms multiplied.

49
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:15,580
And that's the whole Cauchy

50
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,919
Schwarz inequality.

51
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,510
Now we can visualize it with

52
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,139
the same picture we had when

53
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,339
we started with the inner

54
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,059
products in this

55
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:25,510
multiplication X with

56
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,199
Y only the parallel

57
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:28,900
part of Y, the yellow part

58
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,050
here should matter.

59
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:32,160
Then this picture tells you,

60
00:01:32,169 --> 00:01:33,319
yeah, of course, the length

61
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,870
of the yellow part is less

62
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,199
or equal than the length

63
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:37,400
of the wet arrow here.

64
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:39,669
With this in mind, we also

65
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,589
get a result in which cases

66
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,120
the equality here holds

67
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,290
indeed, this should only

68
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,730
be the case when the arrows

69
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,169
go in the same direction.

70
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:50,760
In other words, X and Y

71
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:52,419
are linearly dependent

72
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,099
vectors.

73
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,199
OK.

74
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:55,419
Now the picture gets us in

75
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,919
the correct direction, but

76
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,230
we don't have any choice.

77
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,910
We need to prove the inequality.

78
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:00,319
Now.

79
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,529
OK.

80
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,709
So let's start with an easy

81
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,400
case, let's call it the first

82
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,389
case where X is the zero

83
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,860
vector.

84
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:09,270
Of course, there we know

85
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:10,839
the left hand side has to

86
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:11,589
be zero

87
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,410
simply by the linearity,

88
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:15,940
we can just pull out the

89
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:16,990
factor zero.

90
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,679
And of course, the right

91
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,309
hand side is also zero

92
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,190
because the norm of X has

93
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,089
to be zero here.

94
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:25,440
In particular, the general

95
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:26,970
inequality is

96
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,649
obviously fulfilled for this

97
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,369
simple case.

98
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,570
Now you might already guess

99
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,220
the actual interesting case

100
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:34,559
would be the second one

101
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,869
here X is not a zero

102
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,419
vector, which means we can

103
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:40,270
divide by the norm of X.

104
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:42,789
And that's what we do immediately,

105
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,660
I want to define X hat

106
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,160
as the normalized vector

107
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:48,039
X, this means

108
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,039
that X hat has length one.

109
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,539
So it just gives the direction

110
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,300
of the vector X and

111
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:54,500
then we calculate the inner

112
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:56,070
product with X hat and

113
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,940
Y and go into the

114
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:59,500
direction of X hat.

115
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,070
Now, you might recognize

116
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,660
that because if we have

117
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:05,389
considered the normal Euclidean

118
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:07,070
geometry in the plane, this

119
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,240
picture would be completely

120
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,009
correct.

121
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,860
And this expression is

122
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:12,830
exactly this orange line

123
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:14,699
by our abstraction.

124
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,179
This should be the same here.

125
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,520
So let's call the orange arrow

126
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,009
just y

127
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,899
parallel in the

128
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,039
Euclidean geometry.

129
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,940
This is known as the orthogonal

130
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:25,800
projection of Y on to

131
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:26,470
X.

132
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:28,550
So it makes sense to do the

133
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,020
same for a general in our

134
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:30,619
product.

135
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,119
Now the gray line here is

136
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,639
the orthogonal part which

137
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:35,850
we also can calculate.

138
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,630
Now this is

139
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,050
simply given by Y

140
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:40,729
minus the parallel part.

141
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:41,880
OK.

142
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,220
So we defined some vectors

143
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:44,300
we want to deal with.

144
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:46,380
But now we need an idea how

145
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:47,850
to get to the inequality.

146
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,100
Indeed, the whole idea is

147
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,160
that we can calculate the

148
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:52,940
length or the norm of

149
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:54,240
this or formal part

150
00:03:55,179 --> 00:03:56,910
simply because we know the

151
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,830
norm can't be negative.

152
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,399
Now, on the line we can put

153
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,389
in the definition and then

154
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,149
of course, also the definition

155
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,619
of Y parallel.

156
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,169
Now if you see something

157
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:11,089
like this calculating norms,

158
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,570
but you have an inner product,

159
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,490
it's better to use squares.

160
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:16,769
So square everything and

161
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,309
the square roots will vanish.

162
00:04:19,248 --> 00:04:20,878
And now you can see on the

163
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:22,169
right hand side, we have

164
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,868
this long vector in the middle,

165
00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:25,658
in both components of the

166
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:26,378
inner product.

167
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:28,720
So it looks like this.

168
00:04:29,989 --> 00:04:31,170
And in order to simplify

169
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:32,500
this, we will use the

170
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,410
linearity.

171
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:35,390
And this linearity in the

172
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,950
second component means we

173
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,649
can pull out this minus

174
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,350
sign here.

175
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:41,149
So we have here a product

176
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,000
with Y minus the other

177
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:43,380
part.

178
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:45,390
In the next step, we want

179
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,730
to pull out the minus sign

180
00:04:46,739 --> 00:04:48,570
here And here, and we

181
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,510
know we can do that because

182
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,679
the inner product is

183
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,250
conjugate linear in the

184
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,369
first argument.

185
00:04:54,989 --> 00:04:56,160
So minus signs are not a

186
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:56,769
problem.

187
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:58,230
And scalars get a complex

188
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,989
conjugation.

189
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,839
So that's the first part

190
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,750
and the second part would

191
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,480
be this vector with y?

192
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:05,380
And of course, now we do

193
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,470
the same with the second

194
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
inner product here.

195
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:09,179
OK.

196
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,049
Here we have Y with the vector

197
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:12,100
on the right hand side.

198
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,730
And now we have minus minus.

199
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:15,450
So plus the rest.

200
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,600
In fact, here we have the

201
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,019
same vector left and right

202
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,959
in the inner product.

203
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:21,679
Therefore, now comes the

204
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,160
part where we can rewrite

205
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:23,630
everything.

206
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,109
Again.

207
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,070
The first thing is the norm

208
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,190
of Y squared.

209
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,880
For the two parts in the

210
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,549
middle, we see they are almost

211
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:31,899
the same, the one is the

212
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,260
complex conjugate of the

213
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:33,660
other one.

214
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,440
So we can write it in this

215
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,839
way with parentheses, we

216
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,209
put a bar over the second

217
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:38,640
part.

218
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:41,079
And finally, the last part

219
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:42,760
is the norm of this vector

220
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:43,440
squared.

221
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,760
In the next equality here,

222
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:47,079
I want to simplify that even

223
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:48,709
more because you see

224
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,450
here's a complex number plus

225
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:51,799
the complex conjugate of

226
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,350
this number, which means

227
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,910
this is two times the real

228
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,559
part of this complex

229
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,359
number, which means that

230
00:05:58,369 --> 00:05:59,869
we can write it like this.

231
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,970
And now in the third part,

232
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,500
we can pull out the scalar

233
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,149
which means it comes out

234
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,850
with the absolute value squared,

235
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:09,299
you see it remains the norm

236
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:10,799
of x hat where we already

237
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:12,279
know this is one.

238
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:14,339
Now, finally, I want to simplify

239
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,769
the middle part here, which

240
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:16,839
to be honest, we could have

241
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,750
done before.

242
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,970
But then we would have done

243
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,880
it two times.

244
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,190
I want to show you visually

245
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,350
what we want to do.

246
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,230
We pull this scalar out

247
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,799
from the first argument of

248
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:28,510
the inner product, but

249
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,980
then it gets a complex

250
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:30,679
conjugation.

251
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:32,799
So let's fill in the gaps

252
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,220
again.

253
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,529
And then you see we have

254
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,100
the same complex number left

255
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:36,739
and right.

256
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,130
But the one is the complex

257
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,480
conjugate of the other one.

258
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,510
In other words, it's the

259
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,970
absolute value of the complex

260
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,149
number squared.

261
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,359
And since that is clearly

262
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:47,940
a real number, we can omit

263
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,959
the real part here.

264
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:50,989
So in summary, we have the

265
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,899
norm of Y squared minus two

266
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,309
times this number,

267
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,500
but also plus one

268
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,869
times the same number.

269
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:00,089
Therefore, we can put both

270
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,420
things together and have

271
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:02,600
a simple result here,

272
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,369
the norm of Y squared minus

273
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,720
the inner product in absolute

274
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,540
value squared.

275
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:09,720
So this is our right hand

276
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,529
side and on the left, we

277
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,339
have the zero.

278
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,739
Hence, in the next step,

279
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,660
I want to bring the inner

280
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,339
product to the other side.

281
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,079
Now, you can see we are almost

282
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:21,670
there with our inequality.

283
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:22,859
The only thing missing is

284
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:23,929
that we have to translate

285
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,959
back X hat

286
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,119
which is not so hard to do

287
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,920
because we define it as X

288
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:30,670
divided by the norm of X.

289
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:32,399
Of course, we do the same

290
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,190
as always, we pull out one

291
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,799
divided by the norm of X.

292
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:37,959
Hence, that's what we get.

293
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,239
And you see, we just have

294
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,839
to multiply with the norm

295
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,600
of X squared on both sides.

296
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:45,010
And then taking the square

297
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:46,579
root on both sides, we get

298
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:48,070
out our Cauchy Schwarz

299
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:48,980
inequality.

300
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:51,130
Well, that's the whole proof

301
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,279
of the inequality.

302
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,170
I will skip the part about

303
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:55,970
the equality now because

304
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,790
I want to use time to show

305
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:58,950
you that the symbol we use

306
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,600
here is indeed the norm.

307
00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:02,059
So it fulfills the triangle

308
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,029
inequality.

309
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,700
And we will do that by

310
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:06,220
using the Cauchy Schwarz

311
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,059
inequality.

312
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,880
In fact, the triangle inequality

313
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,200
is most of the time, the

314
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:12,820
hardest part of a proof that

315
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:13,989
something is a norm.

316
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:16,779
So let's do that very quickly.

317
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,059
Of course, we square the

318
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,839
norm again

319
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,119
because then we don't need

320
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,369
the square root, we can just

321
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,350
write X plus YX

322
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:26,000
plus Y in the inner product.

323
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,019
The linearity now gets us

324
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:29,920
to a similar result as before

325
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:32,750
namely the norm of X and

326
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,619
Y squared.

327
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,799
And in the middle, we get

328
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:36,479
two times the real part of

329
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:37,239
the product.

330
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,210
Now, of course, if we use

331
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,409
the absolute value instead

332
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,020
of the real part, it gets

333
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,489
bigger.

334
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:44,710
And of course, here we now

335
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:46,599
can use our Cauchy Schwarz

336
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,510
inequality.

337
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,630
And now knowing the binomial

338
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,109
theorem, you see this is

339
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,669
just the square of the sum

340
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,729
of the two norms

341
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,419
taking the square root on

342
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:56,109
both sides.

343
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,640
You see this is simply the

344
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,130
triangle inequality for the

345
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,820
norm we defined by the inner

346
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,349
product.

347
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:03,210
The other two properties

348
00:09:03,219 --> 00:09:04,609
for norm shouldn't be a problem

349
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:05,250
to show.

350
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:06,789
And therefore now it makes

351
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,650
sense to use this symbol

352
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:09,770
and call it a norm in an

353
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,229
inner product space.

354
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:12,229
OK?

355
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:13,190
I think that's good enough

356
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,909
for today.

357
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,169
In the next videos, we will

358
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,590
talk a little bit more about

359
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:17,669
the geometry.

360
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,989
An inner product gives the

361
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,780
space and I

362
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:22,280
already told you if you need

363
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:23,650
it, you can download the

364
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:25,169
PDF version of this video

365
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:27,159
in the description and of

366
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:28,679
course use the comments if

367
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,599
you have questions.

368
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:30,979
Otherwise I see you in the

369
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:31,609
next video.

370
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,609
Have a nice day.

371
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,289
Bye.
