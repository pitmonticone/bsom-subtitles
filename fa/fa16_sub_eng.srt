00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,059
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,279
 functional analysis.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,659
 And as always, I want to

4
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,059
 thank all the nice people

5
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,619
 that make this video possible

6
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,100
 by supporting me on steady

7
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:09,899
 or paypal.

8
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,659
 Now, we have reached part

9
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,340
 16 in our course.

10
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,029
 And we'll talk about compactness

11
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:15,520
 today.

12
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,969
 The word compact you find

13
00:00:17,979 --> 00:00:19,270
 very often in functional

14
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,000
 analysis.

15
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,510
 However, here we first go

16
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,000
 back to metric spaces.

17
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,409
 It's a property we define

18
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,079
 for subsets in a matrix

19
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,370
 space and it should

20
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:29,899
 extend the finite.

21
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:31,629
 So a finite

22
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:32,810
 set should always be

23
00:00:32,819 --> 00:00:33,650
 compact.

24
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,259
 Then for an infinite set,

25
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,689
 the compactness would say

26
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,389
 that your movement is still

27
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,060
 restricted in a similar way

28
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,880
 to get an idea of what this

29
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:42,930
 actually means.

30
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:44,779
 Let's look at a subset in

31
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,389
 RN.

32
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:47,529
 Of course, we have our N

33
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,080
 with our usual Euclidean

34
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:49,259
 me.

35
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:51,409
 Now, you know what it means

36
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:53,159
 to say that A is a closed

37
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:54,900
 set, the

38
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:56,380
 whole boundary should belong

39
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,750
 to the whole set itself,

40
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,470
 which means you can't leave

41
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,029
 it from the inside by using

42
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,709
 a sequence.

43
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,470
 So you see this is one restriction

44
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,870
 you have for your movement.

45
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:07,739
 And another one comes in.

46
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,250
 If you look at a bounded

47
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,010
 set, this

48
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:12,239
 simply means that there is

49
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,699
 a maximum distance you can

50
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,500
 go, you are not allowed to

51
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,599
 go to infinity.

52
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:18,879
 Now, you might already know

53
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,489
 these two things together

54
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,930
 is what we can shorten to

55
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,849
 compact.

56
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,150
 However, please be careful.

57
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,569
 Actually, this is not a

58
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,430
 definition.

59
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,330
 This is a fact we only have

60
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,239
 in RN or if you

61
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,019
 want also in CN

62
00:01:33,029 --> 00:01:34,209
 together with this standard

63
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:34,709
 metric.

64
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,849
 Therefore, the correct question

65
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,199
 here would be how can we

66
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:39,639
 define compact in

67
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,199
 general such that we get

68
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:42,800
 the correct notion for infinite

69
00:01:42,809 --> 00:01:43,230
 sets?

70
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,800
 Of course, this is now what

71
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:46,480
 we will do.

72
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,389
 So let's fix a metric space

73
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,300
 XD in the

74
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:52,830
 same way as before, let's

75
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,319
 consider a subset of this

76
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:54,900
 space.

77
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:57,650
 And now we define this as

78
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,330
 a compact set or more

79
00:01:59,339 --> 00:02:01,029
 concretely as a sequentially

80
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,910
 compact set.

81
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:04,510
 Maybe you already recognize

82
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,900
 the same thing that happened

83
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,489
 in the continuity definition.

84
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:09,598
 There are two terms you could

85
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:11,598
 define one with sequences

86
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:12,938
 and the other one without

87
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:13,768
 sequences.

88
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,848
 And then the result for metric

89
00:02:15,858 --> 00:02:17,529
 spaces is they are

90
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:18,158
 equivalent.

91
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:19,990
 It's the same thing here,

92
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,289
 but I don't want to bother

93
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,850
 you with the actual compact

94
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,389
 definition.

95
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:25,580
 The term sequentially compact

96
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:27,399
 is just easier to understand

97
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,130
 and we just call it compact.

98
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:31,000
 Now, however, please

99
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:32,240
 keep in mind when you're

100
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,940
 not working in metric spaces.

101
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:35,520
 But in general topological

102
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:37,330
 spaces, you have two terms

103
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:38,639
 that are not equivalent

104
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:39,679
 for us.

105
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,720
 It's not a problem here.

106
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:42,720
 We call a compact if

107
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,130
 for each sequence in a,

108
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,479
 we find a convergent

109
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,410
 subsequence where

110
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,720
 the limit X tilde

111
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:51,410
 still lies in the set

112
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:51,759
 A.

113
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,690
 So you see there's a lot

114
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:55,440
 going on here, you start

115
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:57,250
 with a sequence, then you

116
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:58,490
 omit some members,

117
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:00,070
 which means that you get

118
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,839
 a subsequence, which is

119
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,600
 also convergent where the

120
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,440
 limit still lies in a,

121
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,710
 in the picture.

122
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,199
 This would mean inside a

123
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,529
 set A, we have

124
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:11,229
 infinitely many points

125
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,630
 given by the sequence

126
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,270
 XN.

127
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,449
 Of course, a lot can happen

128
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,490
 for this sequence.

129
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,330
 But compact now means

130
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:20,229
 that you can choose infinitely

131
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,970
 many points in the sequence

132
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:23,250
 such that you get a limit

133
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:23,690
 out.

134
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,860
 For example, here, only one

135
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:27,559
 part remains where we have

136
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,220
 convergence to a point X

137
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,779
 tilde.

138
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,850
 And this should work no matter

139
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,160
 which sequence you started

140
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:33,490
 with.

141
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,699
 Now, if you go back to our

142
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:37,039
 end with this knowledge,

143
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:38,460
 you immediately see this

144
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,089
 excludes unbounded

145
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,020
 because if you tend to

146
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:43,899
 infinity, you can't find

147
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,690
 such a convergence subsequence.

148
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,169
 Also the set has to be closed.

149
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:49,770
 Otherwise you can just choose

150
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:51,539
 a sequence that has a limit

151
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,699
 outside of the set.

152
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,009
 A.

153
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,759
 Then of course, you can't

154
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,039
 add a new limit with a

155
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,809
 subsequence.

156
00:03:57,789 --> 00:03:58,270
 OK.

157
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,690
 Next, let's look at some

158
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:00,410
 examples.

159
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:02,669
 For the first example, let's

160
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,300
 choose a more concrete one

161
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:05,600
 than the one from above.

162
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,039
 So this should be just the

163
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,699
 real number line together

164
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,059
 with the standard metric,

165
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,580
 the Euclidean metric which

166
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:13,800
 is given by the absolute

167
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:14,259
 value.

168
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,730
 And the set A should be given

169
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,329
 as the unit interval.

170
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,428
 Now, in this one dimensional

171
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,928
 case, you should see that

172
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,970
 the formulation with the

173
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,649
 sequences and the convergent

174
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,040
 subsequence is

175
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:27,730
 exactly what you learn in

176
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:28,529
 analysis.

177
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:30,519
 It's the famous Bolzano

178
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:31,769
 Vastra theorem.

179
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:34,200
 Then with this in a tool

180
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:35,970
 set, one can easily show

181
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,730
 the equality here for RN

182
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:39,359
 or CN with the standard

183
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:39,859
 metric.

184
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,160
 Therefore, let's now look

185
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,529
 at the same set together

186
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,609
 with another metric.

187
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:46,709
 So again, the real number

188
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,679
 line, but now with the discrete

189
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,640
 metric, now you might

190
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:52,070
 already guess in this

191
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,850
 case, the unit interval is

192
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:55,049
 not compact.

193
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,880
 In order to show this, you

194
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,850
 just have to find one sequence

195
00:04:58,859 --> 00:05:00,170
 which has no convergence

196
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:01,440
 subsequence at all.

197
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,019
 Hence, let's simply do that.

198
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:05,279
 OK.

199
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,739
 So let's choose to sequence

200
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,989
 XN by setting

201
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,760
 XN as one over

202
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:11,410
 N, it's a

203
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,959
 sequence inside the unit

204
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,350
 interval but it's not

205
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,029
 constant.

206
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,369
 Hence, we already know what

207
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,920
 the distance is between two

208
00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:20,329
 members of the sequence

209
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,220
 we are in the discrete metric

210
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,799
 space.

211
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:24,670
 So we get always one or

212
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:25,929
 two different points.

213
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,239
 However, this now means that

214
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,149
 we could omit a lot of members

215
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,899
 in the sequence, but we never

216
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,579
 get the one down to zero

217
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:33,920
 here.

218
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,959
 In other words, there can't

219
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,959
 be any convergent subsequence.

220
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:40,609
 In conclusion, the unit interval

221
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:42,239
 is not compact with

222
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,839
 respect to the discrete metric.

223
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:44,970
 OK.

224
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,570
 So please keep that in mind,

225
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:48,220
 always emphasize the

226
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,690
 corresponding metric when

227
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,420
 talking about compact sets.

228
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,600
 Now for the end of the video,

229
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:54,880
 I want to show you a nice

230
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,809
 proposition which generalizes

231
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,079
 the results from above,

232
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:00,029
 we have our metric space

233
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,869
 XD and a compact

234
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,730
 set A then

235
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:04,790
 we can conclude.

236
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,470
 So it's an implication not

237
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,309
 an equivalence

238
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,179
 that A is closed

239
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,309
 and bounded.

240
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,390
 So in general, we still have

241
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,049
 the result that closeness

242
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:16,910
 and bounded is needed

243
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,179
 for the compactness.

244
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,109
 It's not the other way around

245
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:21,790
 compactness in general is

246
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:22,440
 more.

247
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,070
 But this can still be helpful

248
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,359
 before writing down the proof,

249
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:27,799
 we should first define what

250
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:29,399
 we mean by a bounded set

251
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,839
 inside the metric space.

252
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,859
 Of course, this is not so

253
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:34,380
 surprising if you have your

254
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,190
 set a here, it

255
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,410
 simply means that you can't

256
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,290
 find a large enough epsilon

257
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,029
 ball such that the whole

258
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,640
 set lies inside this

259
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:43,170
 ball.

260
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:44,989
 So we just have to find a

261
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,489
 middle point X

262
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:48,279
 and a radius epsilon.

263
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:50,170
 And then we want that the

264
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:52,079
 open Epsom ball around

265
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:53,959
 X is a superset for A

266
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,989
 and this is what we mean

267
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,339
 when we say bounded,

268
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,230
 it simply means that there

269
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:01,049
 is a constant such that any

270
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:02,790
 two points have distance

271
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,329
 less than this constant.

272
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,679
 And here you see this constant

273
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,350
 would be just too epsilon.

274
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:09,519
 OK.

275
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,989
 By knowing all the terms

276
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,359
 in the proposition, we now

277
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:13,760
 can write down the proof

278
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:15,779
 starting from a compact set,

279
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,230
 we have to do two things.

280
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,980
 First, we want to show that

281
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:19,959
 A is closed.

282
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,500
 So let's choose a convergence

283
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,429
 sequence in a.

284
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,019
 Hence we know there is a

285
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:25,480
 limit X tilde in

286
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:26,049
 X.

287
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,290
 Now we call, if we can show

288
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:29,760
 that X tilde is actually

289
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:31,519
 in a, then A is closed

290
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:33,750
 using the compactness, we

291
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,890
 immediately get the result

292
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:35,989
 for a subsequence.

293
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,750
 Hence, we have a convergent

294
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,660
 subsequence with limit

295
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,230
 in A.

296
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,630
 And maybe we call this limit

297
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,779
 X tilde tilde.

298
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:45,549
 Of course, this is not necessary

299
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,269
 because we know we already

300
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,670
 started with a convergence

301
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:49,250
 sequence.

302
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:51,329
 And we know the limit is

303
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:52,250
 always unique.

304
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,730
 You can't find another limit

305
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,739
 with a subsequence.

306
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,130
 Hence X tilde and X tilde

307
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,049
 tilde do coincide.

308
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:00,690
 So we know X tilde lies

309
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,589
 also in a, this is

310
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,790
 exactly what we wanted to

311
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:04,290
 show.

312
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,109
 Therefore A is closed.

313
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:07,239
 OK.

314
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,779
 Then the next step is showing

315
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,019
 that A is bounded.

316
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,000
 We do this with a proof by

317
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:12,839
 con interposition.

318
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:14,920
 This means that we start

319
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:16,149
 with a being not

320
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,140
 bounded and we want to end

321
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:19,500
 with a being not

322
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,230
 compact.

323
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,869
 Now, if A is not bounded,

324
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,790
 we know that we can find

325
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:26,720
 distances as large as

326
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,230
 we want.

327
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,890
 Hence, for given point A

328
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:31,609
 in the set A, we

329
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:33,419
 find infinitely many points

330
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,969
 XN in A

331
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,690
 such that the distance to

332
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,340
 A is larger than the

333
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:39,450
 natural number N.

334
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,719
 With this, we have one sequence

335
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:44,409
 XN in A where we can look

336
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:45,409
 at all possible

337
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:46,419
 subsequence.

338
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,770
 Now, if A was compact,

339
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,619
 we would find a subsequence

340
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,419
 with a limit.

341
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,520
 Therefore, let's look at

342
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,929
 all possible limit points

343
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,549
 as well.

344
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,669
 Hence, we would be interested

345
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,030
 in the distance between the

346
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,630
 limit point B and the

347
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,919
 sequence X and K

348
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:03,960
 simply because if the sequence

349
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:05,309
 was convergent, this would

350
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,210
 go to zero.

351
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,010
 However, the only distance

352
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,489
 we know at this point is

353
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,429
 the distance between A and

354
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:11,989
 XN.

355
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:13,979
 And using the subsequence,

356
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:15,840
 we know this is larger than

357
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:16,510
 NK.

358
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,309
 Then on the right hand side,

359
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,039
 we simply can use our triangle

360
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:20,849
 inequality.

361
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,539
 We just put B in the middle,

362
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,869
 then bring the one part on

363
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,070
 the other side and we get

364
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,510
 the following inequality.

365
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:30,590
 So we conclude the distance

366
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:32,580
 between any point B and a

367
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,489
 sequence number X and K is

368
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,950
 always larger or

369
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,789
 equal than this part here.

370
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,190
 However, seeing the NK here,

371
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,590
 you know, you can make the

372
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,429
 left hand side as large as

373
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,950
 you want.

374
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:46,049
 Hence, our conclusion is

375
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:47,460
 no matter which point B you

376
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:48,070
 choose.

377
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,809
 If you send K to infinity,

378
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,650
 this will never go to zero.

379
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:53,969
 So there can't be any limit

380
00:09:53,979 --> 00:09:55,479
 point for the subsequence.

381
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:57,570
 If you fix a point B here,

382
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,770
 you will always run away

383
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,169
 from it.

384
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,440
 And therefore A is not

385
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,190
 compact because we found

386
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,570
 a sequence which does not

387
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,510
 own any convergent subsequence.

388
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:08,580
 And by contras position,

389
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,919
 we finished our proof, a

390
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:11,750
 compact set is always

391
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,390
 bounded.

392
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,109
 OK.

393
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,429
 So now you know the notion

394
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,260
 compact for metric spaces

395
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,520
 and in the next videos, we

396
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,809
 will extend this to

397
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,640
 operators.

398
00:10:20,229 --> 00:10:21,609
 So I hope I see you there.

399
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,140
 Thanks for listening and

400
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,750
 bye.
