00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,140
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,789
 functional analysis.

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:05,570
 And first, as always, I want

4
00:00:05,579 --> 00:00:06,920
 to thank all the nice people

5
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:07,949
 that support this channel

6
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,319
 on Steady or paypal.

7
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:11,569
 Today's part 31 is

8
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:12,840
 still about spectral

9
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:13,619
 theory.

10
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,369
 In particular, we will talk

11
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,000
 about the so called spectral

12
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:17,700
 radius.

13
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:18,950
 For this.

14
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:20,610
 First, please recall that

15
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,059
 we work in a complex Banach

16
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,969
 space X and

17
00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:25,840
 with a bounded linear operator

18
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,530
 T there, we have

19
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,809
 already discussed that the

20
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:30,100
 spectrum of the operator

21
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,690
 T is a subset of the

22
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,750
 complex numbers.

23
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,009
 Indeed, we have shown it's

24
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,950
 a close set.

25
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:38,060
 And as usual, we denote the

26
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:40,060
 spectrum with sigma of T.

27
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,650
 Now the spectral radius just

28
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:44,500
 measures how far the spectrum

29
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:45,909
 is away from zero.

30
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:48,000
 And this is what we denote

31
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:49,479
 by R of T.

32
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,680
 So by definition simply the

33
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:53,099
 suprema of the absolute

34
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,849
 values.

35
00:00:54,279 --> 00:00:55,659
 So you see we can immediately

36
00:00:55,669 --> 00:00:57,360
 define this number here.

37
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,069
 And in this video, we will

38
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,319
 show that this is indeed

39
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,319
 always a finite number

40
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:03,720
 more concretely.

41
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,169
 The spectrum is not the empty

42
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,610
 set and also a

43
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,559
 bounded set.

44
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:08,629
 OK.

45
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:10,370
 Now let's formulate it and

46
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:11,449
 then prove it.

47
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:13,050
 So we have a theorem with

48
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:14,849
 the same assumptions as before

49
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:16,680
 most importantly, we have

50
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,169
 a bounded linear operator

51
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,370
 from X to X.

52
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,599
 Then our first statement

53
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,540
 is that the spectrum of T

54
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,089
 as a subset of the complex

55
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:26,919
 numbers is a compact set.

56
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:29,199
 Please recall in the last

57
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:30,839
 video, we have already shown

58
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:32,160
 that it is a closed set.

59
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:33,879
 Therefore, the new thing

60
00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:35,489
 here is that the set is

61
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,690
 also bounded.

62
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,529
 Then our next statement here

63
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,209
 is that the spectrum is never

64
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,809
 empty.

65
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:43,080
 However, this is not completely

66
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:44,790
 true because there is one

67
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,199
 case where this can happen,

68
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:47,760
 it happens when you choose

69
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:49,339
 the smallest possible vector

70
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:49,879
 space.

71
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,449
 So when the whole vector

72
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,410
 space is only the zero vector,

73
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:54,980
 then there's only one linear

74
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,800
 map T and is

75
00:01:56,809 --> 00:01:58,160
 always invertible.

76
00:01:58,169 --> 00:01:59,559
 Therefore, the spectrum needs

77
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:00,440
 to be empty.

78
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,360
 However, when we exclude

79
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,800
 this in fairness boring

80
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:05,419
 case, then the

81
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,000
 implication is correct, the

82
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,809
 spectrum of T is non

83
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,449
 empty.

84
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:10,130
 OK.

85
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,070
 Then the last part C is about

86
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,440
 the spectral radius.

87
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,070
 As I already told you the

88
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,710
 spectral radius are of

89
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,970
 T is given by the

90
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:19,750
 supreme where we go

91
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,309
 through all the points lambda

92
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,250
 in the spectrum.

93
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:23,410
 And we look at the absolute

94
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:23,910
 value.

95
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,809
 Now, one important result

96
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,529
 here is that instead of calculating

97
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:29,270
 a supreme, we can look at

98
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:31,210
 a limit and there we take

99
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,509
 the operator norm of the

100
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,649
 powers of T.

101
00:02:34,429 --> 00:02:35,720
 Then outside of the norm

102
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:37,360
 we take the k-th root again,

103
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:39,339
 one additional result is

104
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,259
 that this sequence is monotonically

105
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,059
 decreasing.

106
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,699
 So the limit is equal to

107
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,199
 the infimum.

108
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,639
 However, most importantly,

109
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:47,990
 we get the result that the

110
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,470
 whole spectral radius is

111
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,130
 bounded by the operator norm

112
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:51,649
 of T.

113
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,309
 Therefore, please always

114
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,020
 remember the spectral radius

115
00:02:55,029 --> 00:02:56,570
 can never be bigger than

116
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,669
 the operator norm.

117
00:02:58,029 --> 00:02:59,350
 And this is not something

118
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,979
 we can immediately prove

119
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,850
 for this.

120
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,199
 Let's use the properties

121
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,710
 we used in the last video.

122
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,669
 For example, the Neumann

123
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:08,350
 series is very helpful here.

124
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,369
 Therefore, let's take a complex

125
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,029
 number lambda which is in

126
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,259
 the absolute value greater

127
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,410
 than the operator norm.

128
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:15,949
 And now we want to show that

129
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,389
 this number can't be in the

130
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:18,509
 spectrum of T.

131
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:20,479
 And in fact, this is immediately

132
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,250
 given by the Neumann series.

133
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,169
 It tells us that the identity

134
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:25,860
 operator minus an operator

135
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:27,250
 S is always

136
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:28,979
 invertible if the

137
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,770
 norm of S is less

138
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:31,550
 than one.

139
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:33,820
 And in this case, the inverse

140
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,600
 that exists is given by this

141
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,750
 infinite series.

142
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:38,429
 And now, in our case, of

143
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,309
 course, instead of S we take

144
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,059
 T divided by Lambda

145
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:44,220
 by assumption this operator

146
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:45,869
 here has operator norm

147
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,080
 less than one.

148
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:48,529
 And now you should see it's

149
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:50,330
 a very short way from this

150
00:03:50,339 --> 00:03:51,789
 to T minus Lambda,

151
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:53,679
 we just have to multiply

152
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,440
 this with minus one

153
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:56,509
 over Lambda.

154
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:58,270
 In the end, we get a very

155
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,199
 nice expression for T minus

156
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,470
 Lambda inverse.

157
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,949
 Of course, the important

158
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,419
 result is this inverse

159
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:06,389
 exists as a bounded linear

160
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,149
 operator.

161
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:09,059
 Moreover, I would say you

162
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,339
 should also remember this

163
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,149
 formula here that holds for

164
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,660
 Lambda that are large enough.

165
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:14,500
 OK.

166
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:16,059
 Now we conclude this lambda

167
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:17,928
 here is not in the spectrum.

168
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,579
 Therefore, this supreme here

169
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,298
 is indeed less or equal than

170
00:04:21,309 --> 00:04:22,829
 the operator norm of T.

171
00:04:22,869 --> 00:04:24,760
 In addition, this implies

172
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:26,540
 that the spectrum of T is

173
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:27,250
 bounded.

174
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,579
 And I already told you, we

175
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:30,660
 know from the last video

176
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,059
 that the set is closed.

177
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,450
 Therefore, we have proven

178
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:35,190
 a additionally, you

179
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,079
 see that one part of C is

180
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:38,649
 also already proven.

181
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,450
 However, now I want to skip

182
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:41,929
 the other parts of C and

183
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,329
 concentrate on B

184
00:04:43,739 --> 00:04:45,170
 because there we can also

185
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,600
 use immediately some facts

186
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:47,679
 from the last video.

187
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,440
 So here we can do a proof

188
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,470
 by contraposition.

189
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,559
 So let's assume that the

190
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,480
 spectrum of T is the empty

191
00:04:53,489 --> 00:04:53,869
 set.

192
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,869
 No spectrum at all means

193
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,130
 that the resolvent set is

194
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,470
 the whole complex plane.

195
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,839
 So row of T is C

196
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,000
 and now you can recall the

197
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,899
 fact that the resolvent map

198
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,179
 is an analytic map

199
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:08,470
 more concretely the map that

200
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,109
 takes lambda and sends it

201
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,290
 to T minus lambda

202
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:12,890
 inverse can be

203
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:14,640
 locally expressed by a Taylor

204
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:15,329
 series.

205
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:16,709
 This is what we have shown

206
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,570
 last time.

207
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:19,250
 And now we can use it.

208
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,070
 OK.

209
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,739
 Since you know a lot of functional

210
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,519
 analysis at this point, it

211
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:24,829
 shouldn't be a problem for

212
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,059
 you.

213
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,579
 When we now use the dual

214
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:28,109
 space of BX,

215
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:30,089
 this space of bounded linear

216
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,049
 operators is a Banach space.

217
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:33,250
 Therefore, it has a well

218
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,649
 defined dual space

219
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:36,700
 which I always denote with

220
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:37,299
 the prime.

221
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,390
 Therefore, this L is now

222
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,100
 a linear functional defined

223
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:42,290
 on the operators.

224
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,019
 And of course, now I want

225
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,980
 to apply the L to this

226
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:47,010
 operator here.

227
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:48,660
 Now you see we get a nice

228
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,230
 map fl from the resolvent

229
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:51,519
 set into C

230
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,450
 because the linear function

231
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,279
 in L maps into the complex

232
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:55,880
 numbers.

233
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:57,600
 Also by assumption we know

234
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:59,000
 the resolvent set is given

235
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,600
 by the whole complex plane.

236
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,100
 So what we have here is a

237
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:03,600
 very nice analytic

238
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:05,000
 function, an

239
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,399
 alternative name for this

240
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,279
 is the notion holomorphic.

241
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,260
 Therefore, now at this point,

242
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,609
 you can use everything you

243
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:13,450
 know from complex analysis.

244
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,480
 Indeed, what we get is that

245
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:17,059
 FL is a bounded

246
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,320
 entire function

247
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,130
 here.

248
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,700
 The term entire is not so

249
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:21,640
 complicated.

250
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,570
 It simply means analytic

251
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:25,160
 together with the domain

252
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:25,679
 C.

253
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,480
 So the entire complex

254
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:28,959
 plane is the domain

255
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:30,480
 and that the function is

256
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:31,959
 bounded we can easily show.

257
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,859
 Now of course, there we

258
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:35,119
 just have to look what happens

259
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,790
 for large lambda values.

260
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:38,500
 And here for us, it turns

261
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,239
 out that two times the operator

262
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,920
 norm of T is already

263
00:06:41,929 --> 00:06:43,820
 large enough because for

264
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:45,290
 these LAMBDAS, we can simply

265
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:46,970
 use our equation star from

266
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,500
 above.

267
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,369
 More concretely, let's take

268
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,179
 fl of lambda in the

269
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,079
 absolute value.

270
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:53,880
 Then by definition, this

271
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,079
 is less or equal than the

272
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:56,510
 operator norm of L

273
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:58,570
 times the operator norm of

274
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:00,410
 T minus lambda inverse.

275
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,309
 And exactly for this norm,

276
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,829
 we can use our Neumann series

277
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,260
 here.

278
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,269
 This means that this is less

279
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,929
 or equal where we have one

280
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,290
 over the absolute value of

281
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:10,829
 Lambda in front and then

282
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,160
 comes the infinite sum of

283
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,089
 the operator norm of T divided

284
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,799
 by lambda to the power K.

285
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,869
 And now, by assumption, we

286
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,630
 know this operator here

287
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,380
 has an operator norm which

288
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,910
 is less or equal than one

289
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,410
 half.

290
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,790
 So what remains here is just

291
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:27,250
 a geometric series, you can

292
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,190
 calculate more concretely.

293
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,040
 The value is less or equal

294
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:31,609
 than two.

295
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,100
 And because we can also estimate

296
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:35,809
 this one here, we have our

297
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,660
 bound, the absolute value

298
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,329
 of our function F Lambda

299
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:41,290
 is simply less or equal

300
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:43,029
 than the operator norm of

301
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,829
 L divided by the operator

302
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,609
 norm of T.

303
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:46,440
 OK.

304
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,209
 So this tells us that FL

305
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,179
 is indeed a bounded entire

306
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,799
 function.

307
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:53,160
 And now from complex analysis,

308
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,079
 we can apply Liouville's 

309
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:56,929
 theorem, it tells

310
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,279
 us that a bounded entire

311
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,880
 function needs to be a

312
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,049
 constant function.

313
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,720
 And please note here this

314
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,309
 fact holds no matter which

315
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,160
 linear functional L we choose.

316
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:07,170
 OK.

317
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:08,230
 Since we have a constant

318
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:09,630
 function, we can simply

319
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,200
 calculate this constant,

320
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,880
 we can simply put in one

321
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,410
 point into the function.

322
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,029
 And of course, the simplest

323
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,410
 one would be zero

324
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:19,329
 and there we just have L

325
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:20,660
 of T inverse.

326
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:22,779
 And now this value is the

327
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,480
 only value the function can

328
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:25,459
 have.

329
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,269
 Therefore, we have this equality

330
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,890
 for all complex numbers

331
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:29,369
 lambda.

332
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,359
 OK.

333
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:31,540
 Now this is the definition

334
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:32,489
 of the function.

335
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,010
 And now I want to put in

336
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,830
 what we already know of this

337
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,539
 inverse.

338
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,340
 As a reminder we often call

339
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:40,058
 this inverse simply the

340
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,940
 resolve from the

341
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,739
 last video we know this is

342
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,580
 analytic.

343
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,780
 Therefore, we can put in

344
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:47,539
 the Taylor series we calculated

345
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:47,900
 there.

346
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,750
 And it simply looked like

347
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,460
 this not so

348
00:08:51,469 --> 00:08:52,859
 complicated because here

349
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:54,150
 you see the coefficients

350
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:55,460
 and there we have lambda

351
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:56,719
 minus lambda zero.

352
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,289
 And to make it simpler, we

353
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:00,020
 can just put lambda 0 to

354
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,609
 0.

355
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,330
 So we can simply erase it

356
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,260
 here and there.

357
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:05,739
 OK.

358
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,400
 Now this is much nicer and

359
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:09,159
 now we can pull in L

360
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,000
 and of course, then we get

361
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,460
 our Taylor series for

362
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,109
 fl so you see

363
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:16,080
 coefficients here and lambda

364
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,239
 to the power K here.

365
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,299
 OK, maybe still a little

366
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,280
 bit complicated.

367
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:22,039
 But remember we know the

368
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:23,289
 function is constant.

369
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,710
 Therefore all the coefficients

370
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:27,229
 after the term K is equal

371
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,770
 to zero will vanish.

372
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:30,530
 Therefore, for example, the

373
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:31,750
 term that corresponds to

374
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,549
 K is equal to one is

375
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,030
 zero.

376
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,630
 So this means L of T to the

377
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,460
 power minus two is zero.

378
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,510
 And again, as a reminder,

379
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,070
 this fact holds now for

380
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,570
 all linear functionals

381
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,609
 and now every time you see

382
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:46,869
 something like this, you

383
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,989
 should immediately think

384
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,739
 of the Hahn-Banach theorem.

385
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:50,940
 And in the case, you don't

386
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,619
 remember it.

387
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,260
 Look at part 25.

388
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,190
 Again, it tells us

389
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,900
 that if we put in the same

390
00:09:56,909 --> 00:09:58,820
 point into all functionals

391
00:09:58,979 --> 00:10:00,299
 and the result is always

392
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,109
 zero, then the point has

393
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,340
 to be zero as well.

394
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:05,140
 So for us, this means this

395
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,469
 operator is the zero

396
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:08,419
 operator however, it's an

397
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:09,179
 inverse.

398
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,299
 Therefore, this shouldn't

399
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,159
 happen at all.

400
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,289
 The only case where this

401
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:14,349
 strange thing can happen

402
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:16,190
 is if we start with the trivial

403
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,820
 vector space and

404
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,489
 usually we don't do that.

405
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,580
 Therefore, the result is

406
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,080
 that in all other interesting

407
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,729
 cases, especially for

408
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:25,890
 infinite dimensional vector

409
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,619
 spaces, the spectrum of an

410
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,460
 operator is never empty.

411
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:30,570
 OK.

412
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,179
 So this was a lot but I hope

413
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,190
 you could follow here.

414
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,900
 In that case, I see you in

415
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:36,179
 the next video when we go

416
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,549
 deeper into the field of

417
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,789
 spectral theory.

418
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:40,150
 Have a nice day.

419
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:40,820
 Bye.
