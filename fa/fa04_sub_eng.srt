Hello and welcome back to functional analysis

2
00:00:03,615 --> 00:00:08,829
and as always I want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:13,356
Today's part 4 is about sequences, limits and closed sets.

4
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:19,863
So you see, we're still building up the foundations we need for doing functional analysis.

5
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:27,678
Now, for metric spaces it turns out that one can use sequences to describe the properties of a metric space.

6
00:00:28,343 --> 00:00:35,112
You might already know, a sequence is just an ordered sets of points inside the metric space X,

7
00:00:35,771 --> 00:00:40,257
because we give the points names, we usually see a notation like this

8
00:00:41,157 --> 00:00:44,871
or in short you just write x_n with n in N.

9
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:52,657
Of course in the formal way you would say, you just have a map from the natural numbers into the metric space X,

10
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:59,991
because we can measure distances in a metric space, we can also talk about convergent sequences.

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,729
A sequence x_n in a metric space (X,d), which means all the x_n come from a set X,

12
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:15,240
is called convergent if there is a limit point we call x tilde.

13
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:23,503
So what we want is that the members of the sequence get closer and closer to this limit point x tilde.

14
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:30,617
Of course we already know how to measure such closeness. We can just use an arbitrary epsilon-ball.

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,386
It should be centered at x tilde,

16
00:01:33,387 --> 00:01:40,863
but then no matter how small we choose the epsilon, almost all the members of the sequence should be inside this ball.

17
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:48,712
More exactly this means we find an index such that members with a bigger index lie inside the epsilon-ball.

18
00:01:49,514 --> 00:01:54,324
Formally this reads then: for all epsilon greater 0,

19
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:57,501
there exists an index capital N

20
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:02,020
such that all the other indices greater or equal this capital N

21
00:02:02,943 --> 00:02:10,659
fulfill that the distance between x_n and our limit point x tilde is less than epsilon.

22
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:17,848
In this case we then write x_n tends to x tilde if n goes to infinity.

23
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:27,112
Alternatively we also use the limit notation. So we write limit n to infinity of x_n is equal to x tilde.

24
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:34,491
If you see such notations please remind yourself that these are always given with respect to a metric d

25
00:02:34,691 --> 00:02:37,092
and of course we can use such notations,

26
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:43,940
because in a metric space there can only be at most one x tilde that fulfills all of these things here.

27
00:02:44,643 --> 00:02:47,929
You can easily show that using the triangle inequality.

28
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:56,693
Later we will see a lot of examples of convergent sequences. Therefore I would say we start here proving another important fact.

29
00:02:57,414 --> 00:03:04,139
Here we look again at a subset of the metric space X and we can say that this one is closed, 

30
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:10,645
if and only if we can't leave the set from the inside by just using sequences.

31
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:17,635
More exactly this means that a limit such a sequence could have must lie in the set A.

32
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:26,363
This is fitting for our visualization, because closeness means that this boundary we see here already belongs to the set A.

33
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:30,987
Writing that down gives us then: for every convergent sequence a_n,

34
00:03:31,187 --> 00:03:34,941
where a_n is just an element in capital A.

35
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:42,589
So it's a sequence inside A and usually one uses the sloppy notation writing it down as a subset of A.

36
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:48,752
The important part here is of course, we have a convergent sequence, but only in the sense of the definition.

37
00:03:48,952 --> 00:03:54,444
So it's a convergent sequence in the space X. So it has a limit inside X.

38
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:57,146
However for the proposition we need more.

39
00:03:57,346 --> 00:04:04,011
We need that the limit, that we know exists, is also an element of A.

40
00:04:04,814 --> 00:04:11,972
Ok, so this is important because now we have a characterization for closed sets just by using sequences.

41
00:04:12,457 --> 00:04:16,439
Ok, then let's do the proof, where we have to show 2 directions.

42
00:04:16,786 --> 00:04:21,979
I want to start with the one from right to left, because we can just do the contraposition here.

43
00:04:22,843 --> 00:04:26,477
Hence we have to assume that A is not closed.

44
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:31,443
Hence by definition the complement is not open.

45
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:36,356
Now please recall open means that for each point inside the set,

46
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,768
you find an epsilon-ball around this point, such that the whole ball is inside A^c in this case.

47
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:49,210
Not open then means that there is at least one x tilde where this is not the case.

48
00:04:49,543 --> 00:04:58,234
So you find an x tilde here on the boundary such that you can use any epsilon-ball, but you always hit points in A.

49
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:06,425
Hence we conclude that we can construct a sequence a_n, where each a_n comes from one of these sets here,

50
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:10,188
where for example we set epsilon as 1 over n.

51
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:15,562
If we do that then we know that a_n converges to x tilde,

52
00:05:15,643 --> 00:05:20,473
because we get closer and closer to x tilde if we increase the index n.

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,729
Ok, so this is our result.

54
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:28,429
We now have a sequence in A, which is convergent, but its limit is not in A.

55
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:35,404
Ok, so this was our proof by contraposition. Which means this implication is now finished.

56
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:40,229
So, let's do the other direction then, where I also want to use a contraposition.

57
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:46,258
Here we now assume that there is a convergent sequence in A where the limit is not in A

58
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,284
and as before I want to call this limit just x tilde.

59
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:53,259
So we have the same picture as here.

60
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:56,268
Now you know by the definition of the limit

61
00:05:56,468 --> 00:06:02,871
you can use any epsilon-ball around x tilde, you will always hit points of the sequence.

62
00:06:02,923 --> 00:06:04,607
So inside A

63
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,664
and this then means that A^c, the complement of A is not an open set.

64
00:06:12,114 --> 00:06:17,238
However then by definition the set A itself is not a closed set

65
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:23,611
and as you can see this closes our proof here. The proposition is correct.

66
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:30,472
Maybe we also close the video here. In the next part we will talk about complete metric spaces

67
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,691
and there we will discuss some examples and you'll see why it is helpful to deal with sequences.

68
00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:42,029
So, thanks for listening and hopefully I see you there. Bye!
