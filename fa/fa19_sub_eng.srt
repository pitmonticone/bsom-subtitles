00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,289
Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:03,589
functional analysis

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:04,929
and as always, I want to

4
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,320
thank all the nice people

5
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:07,590
that support this channel

6
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:09,039
on Steady or PayPal.

7
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:11,689
In today's part 19, we

8
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:13,420
will go back and prove Hölder's

9
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,369
inequality.

10
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,530
There are a lot of different

11
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,930
inequalities named after

12
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,350
Hölder and indeed, they are

13
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,309
all related,

14
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:21,850
but here we look at the simplest

15
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,639
one. It's the one that

16
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:24,979
holds in F^n

17
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:26,739
and for p greater than one.

18
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,190
For each such number p, there

19
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,870
is a Hölder conjugate which

20
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:32,119
we call p prime.

21
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:34,080
The definition is what you

22
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,479
should really memorize.

23
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,020
The reciprocals should add

24
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:37,610
to one.

25
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,729
This is an important relation,

26
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,130
because every time we use

27
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:42,750
p prime, this is what we

28
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:44,529
mean. Instead of p

29
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,099
prime, a lot of people just

30
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:46,830
use q.

31
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,979
However, here I want to use

32
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,790
q as another variable to

33
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,590
tell you again what the p-

34
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:53,380
norm was.

35
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,240
Or today, I would better

36
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,049
say the q-norm of a vector

37
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,450
x.

38
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,080
It's defined by the sum over

39
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,569
the entries in the absolute

40
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,049
value to the power q

41
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:05,370
and then we take the q-th root

42
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,290
of the whole thing

43
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,470
and this is what we do for

44
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,980
all q between one and

45
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:11,769
infinity including one.

46
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,269
Now Hölder inequality will

47
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:15,849
connect the p-norm the p

48
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,550
prime-norm and the 1-

49
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:19,489
norm. Indeed, it's one

50
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,839
nice short formula,

51
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:22,160
you always should remember.

52
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:24,510
I will now use a possibly

53
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:26,110
strange notation to help

54
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,699
you to remember the important

55
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:29,610
inequality. Putting two

56
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,250
vectors together just

57
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,110
denotes a new vector which

58
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,949
has the product in the components.

59
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,930
So x_2, y_2 in the

60
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,559
second component and

61
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:39,849
x_n times y_n

62
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,580
in the last component.

63
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,760
Then for all vectors x and

64
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,650
y, we have that the 1-norm

65
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,440
of the vector xy

66
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,430
is less or equal than the

67
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,309
p-norm of x times the p

68
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,720
prime-norm of y

69
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,830
and that's what we call

70
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:56,029
Hölder's inequality.

71
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,720
Often you see it written

72
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,199
with the sums, but I think

73
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:00,910
it's better to write it immediately

74
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:02,599
in this way. On the one

75
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,269
hand, it's easier to remember

76
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,680
and on the other hand, we

77
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,919
will generalize the whole

78
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,860
thing later on.

79
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,899
Indeed, there we will have

80
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,199
the whole inequality for

81
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,160
functions defined on an abstract

82
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:13,929
measure space.

83
00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:15,479
However, that's not what

84
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,770
we do today. Today

85
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:18,149
we prove it for vectors

86
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,869
in F^n.

87
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:20,880
In order to prove Hölder's

88
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:22,610
inequality, we first need

89
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:24,130
another inequality which

90
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:25,490
is known as Young's

91
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,440
inequality.

92
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,649
In fact, this one is very

93
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,250
simple.

94
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:30,589
We just look at positive

95
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,550
numbers a, b and

96
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:33,850
then we conclude that the

97
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,529
product of ab is

98
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:37,210
always less or equal than

99
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,309
the following sum.

100
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,630
So what you should see here

101
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,160
is that p greater than one

102
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:42,850
goes in and the Hölder

103
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,610
conjugate.

104
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:45,940
So as before you can choose

105
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:47,669
p greater one as you want,

106
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,470
but then p prime is fixed.

107
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,610
For example, for p equals

108
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:53,570
to two, we have p prime equals

109
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,110
to two.

110
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,910
However, in this case, you

111
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,619
already know that the inequality

112
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,509
here is correct.

113
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,479
So please check that,

114
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,759
but for all other cases,

115
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,380
we have to write down a proof.

116
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,570
What we can use here is that

117
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,210
the common exponential function

118
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,929
is a so called convex

119
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,369
function.

120
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:11,190
This means that when you

121
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,279
look at the graph,

122
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,389
then you can choose any two

123
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:14,779
points

124
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:15,630
as you want.

125
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,929
The direct connection would

126
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,630
be always above the graph.

127
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,940
This property is called convex,

128
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:22,509
because the red line is the

129
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,100
convex combination of the

130
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,839
two points.

131
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,479
Therefore, we can easily

132
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,029
put that into a formula when

133
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,449
we call the function just

134
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:29,910
f.

135
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,990
Now, by denoting the two points

136
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,669
by x and y, we can form a

137
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,410
convex combination of x and

138
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:37,369
y and put that into the function

139
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,300
f. Which means we get out

140
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:40,220
the blue line here.

141
00:03:40,589 --> 00:03:42,339
Please recall a convex

142
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,940
combination is just a special

143
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:45,179
linear combination, where

144
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,940
we only have one lambda which

145
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:48,029
comes from the interval

146
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,199
0 to 1.

147
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,660
Now with the red line, we

148
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:52,289
also get a convex combination

149
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,789
with the images. Which means

150
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,029
we have here instead of x

151
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,899
and y, just f(x)

152
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,899
and f(y).

153
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:59,770
Therefore being always above

154
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:01,199
the blue graph means we have

155
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,669
here our inequality.

156
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,949
Which we now want to use

157
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,229
for some special numbers.

158
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,339
Lambda should be one over

159
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,110
p and then one minus

160
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,509
lambda should be one over

161
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,240
p prime.

162
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:13,789
Maybe that's not so clear

163
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,360
but for x I want to put in

164
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:16,720
the natural logarithm of

165
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,108
a to the power p

166
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,640
and the similar thing for

167
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,559
y but now with b and p

168
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,540
prime. Of course, this

169
00:04:23,549 --> 00:04:25,059
all fits together, because

170
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,329
by applying the logarithm

171
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:27,779
rules, we can bring this

172
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,559
power in front, where it cancels

173
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,779
out. Hence,

174
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,779
on the left-hand side, we

175
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,029
have the two logarithms in

176
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,940
the function f.

177
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,089
Now using the next logarithm

178
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,619
rule

179
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,239
and the fact that the exponential

180
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,820
function is the inverse function

181
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:41,179
of the logarithm, we have

182
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,859
just ab on the left-hand

183
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:43,290
side

184
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,980
and now you see the idea

185
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:46,390
of the whole proof. We want

186
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,140
to show this one and we're

187
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:49,380
already finished with the

188
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,179
left part.

189
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,940
Regarding the right-hand

190
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,220
side, we just put in all

191
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,609
the numbers we already know.

192
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,869
Now this looks more complicated

193
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,230
than it really is, because

194
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,500
we have again the inverse

195
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,670
function of the logarithm

196
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:01,029
here.

197
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:03,170
Hence this all vanishes

198
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:04,309
and what remains is what

199
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,309
we wanted to show.

200
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:07,320
So Young's inequality is

201
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:08,829
correct and we can use it

202
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,750
to prove Hölder's inequality.

203
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,410
Starting with the proof,

204
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,480
let's first consider the

205
00:05:13,489 --> 00:05:14,420
simplest case.

206
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,320
What I mean by that is that

207
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:17,549
we look what happens when

208
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:19,239
x is the zero vector or

209
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,579
y is the zero vector,

210
00:05:21,179 --> 00:05:22,459
but of course, this is not

211
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,899
a problem for us, because

212
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,269
by the definition of all

213
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,799
the norms here, we have that

214
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:28,250
the left-hand side is zero

215
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,459
and the right-hand side is

216
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:29,850
zero.

217
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:31,820
So the inequality is fulfilled.

218
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,739
Therefore, for the second

219
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,529
case, we can divide and bring

220
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,660
everything to the left-hand

221
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,070
side.

222
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,880
Of course, now we want to

223
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,609
bring this inside the norm

224
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:42,290
and divide x by its p-

225
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:44,250
norm and y by its p prime-

226
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,640
norm.

227
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:46,380
However, since I use this

228
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,760
strange notation here, I

229
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:49,339
bring in now the whole sum

230
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,299
of the 1-norm. Here we have

231
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,649
it and we can pull in the

232
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,250
norm into the sum and then

233
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,299
into the absolute value

234
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:56,929
and there you should see

235
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,679
now, that we have two positive

236
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,149
numbers, which we could call

237
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,989
a and b and then apply

238
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,899
Young's inequality inside

239
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,459
the sum.

240
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,380
So at this point, we get

241
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,690
the inequality sign in.

242
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:08,700
OK.

243
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:10,010
The first term is one over

244
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:11,940
p times x_j

245
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,739
to the power p divided by

246
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,450
the p-norm to the power p.

247
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,410
The second term looks similar

248
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,570
and I already distributed

249
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,089
the sum over both parts.

250
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:22,329
So here we just have p prime

251
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:23,799
and j instead of x.

252
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,769
However, that's not so important.

253
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:26,869
The important thing you should

254
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,279
see is what we have in

255
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,600
the numerator together with

256
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:31,109
the sum, is the same as the

257
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:32,809
denominator and the

258
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,119
same in the second part.

259
00:06:34,549 --> 00:06:35,760
Hence, the only things that

260
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:37,640
remain is one over p here

261
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:39,160
and one over p prime here

262
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,880
and by the definition of

263
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,470
the Hölder conjugate this

264
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
is simply one

265
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,540
and with this, we have proven

266
00:06:45,549 --> 00:06:47,200
Hölder's inequality, because

267
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:48,630
you can bring this one on

268
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,760
the right-hand side again,

269
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:50,440
if you want.

270
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,459
So you see the proof was

271
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,869
not so hard, but we will

272
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,630
need Hölder's inequality to

273
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,309
prove another inequality

274
00:06:57,739 --> 00:06:58,839
and this one will be the

275
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,149
so called Minkowski

276
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,010
inequality.

277
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,790
Essentially, it's just the

278
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,869
triangle inequality for our l^p

279
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,470
space.

280
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,220
Therefore, I hope I see you

281
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,070
in the next video.

282
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,579
Thanks for listening and

283
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:10,410
see you then.

284
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,109
Bye.
