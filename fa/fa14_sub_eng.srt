00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,269
Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:03,869
functional analysis.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,329
And many, many thanks to

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,690
all the nice people that

5
00:00:06,699 --> 00:00:08,619
support me on Steady or paypal

6
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:09,729
today.

7
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:11,619
In part 14, I want to show

8
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,119
you one example how to

9
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,720
calculate the operator norm.

10
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,729
In this example, our norm

11
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:18,590
space X should be given by

12
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,930
the continuous functions.

13
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,590
The domain of the functions

14
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,079
should be the unit interval

15
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,010
and the co domain, the complex

16
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,159
or real numbers.

17
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,719
And the common norm for the

18
00:00:27,729 --> 00:00:29,600
space is this a premium norm.

19
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,250
And the second space Y should

20
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,740
be just the complex or real

21
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,139
numbers together with the

22
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,020
absolute value.

23
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,060
Hence today, we will consider

24
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:39,580
a map T that sends a

25
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,400
continuous function to just

26
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:41,880
a number.

27
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,009
In order to define this

28
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,869
operator, I want to fix a

29
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,419
continuous function G

30
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,380
to make our life a little

31
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:50,200
bit easier.

32
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:51,580
The function G shouldn't

33
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,029
have any zeros.

34
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:54,939
Now, for each such G, we

35
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,939
define an operator T and

36
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,340
therefore I put an index

37
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,139
G to it.

38
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,549
Now the operator sends a

39
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,150
function F to a number.

40
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,709
By the following definition,

41
00:01:05,669 --> 00:01:06,930
it's the integral of the

42
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,930
function G multiplied

43
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,290
with the function F

44
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,669
now because we are only dealing

45
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,180
with continuous functions.

46
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,889
You can read this as an Riemann

47
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,849
integral or an leak integral.

48
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,459
It does not matter the

49
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,150
question for us is, is

50
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,739
this a bounded operator

51
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,019
or a similar question?

52
00:01:25,029 --> 00:01:26,500
What is the operator norm

53
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:27,580
for this?

54
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:29,279
Please recall that the operator

55
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,940
norm of TG is

56
00:01:30,949 --> 00:01:32,349
given by a suprema

57
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,419
more concretely we have the

58
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,889
norm of the output

59
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,660
divided by the norm of the

60
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:38,139
input.

61
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:40,559
And then we go over all functions

62
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,419
of X with the exception of

63
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,379
the zero vector.

64
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:45,589
So what we can always do

65
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,500
is apply the scaling as we

66
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,330
did it last time we can

67
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:50,839
do that such that we only

68
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:51,839
divide by one.

69
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:53,669
So we consider only functions

70
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,300
with supreme norm

71
00:01:55,309 --> 00:01:55,839
one.

72
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:57,360
Of course, you don't have

73
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,540
to do that, but it makes

74
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,110
our life easier because we

75
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,459
don't have to write down

76
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,440
a fraction here.

77
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,019
In the next step, we just

78
00:02:04,029 --> 00:02:05,089
fill in what we know from

79
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:06,430
the image we have here.

80
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,760
The absolute value of this

81
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:08,460
integral.

82
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,309
This integral is of course

83
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,830
what we need to calculate.

84
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,509
But maybe a better first

85
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,630
step would be to find an

86
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,389
estimate.

87
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,229
Now, I want to use the knowledge

88
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,389
that pulling the absolute

89
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:20,270
value into the integral

90
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:21,770
only makes it bigger or it

91
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:22,509
stays the same.

92
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:24,429
And then we just use the

93
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,110
multiplicativity of the absolute

94
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:27,779
value, which means we can

95
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:29,399
pull out the multiplication

96
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:29,860
sign.

97
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,830
Then in the next step, we

98
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:32,970
see that we have here the

99
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:34,839
absolute value of F at some

100
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,770
point T.

101
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,869
However, this can't be bigger

102
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,529
than the largest value, which

103
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:41,089
is given by the supreme norm,

104
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:42,660
which means that we have

105
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:43,639
here constant.

106
00:02:43,649 --> 00:02:44,970
And we already fixed that

107
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:45,720
to one.

108
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,389
In summary, the supreme can't

109
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,949
change anything anymore.

110
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,630
So we know the operator norm

111
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,110
can't be bigger than the

112
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:54,509
integral of G.

113
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:56,639
And we already know this

114
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:58,279
is a finite number because

115
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:00,080
we have a positive continuous

116
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:01,800
function inside the integral.

117
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,139
So indeed, this is a bounded

118
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,880
operator.

119
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,009
The last question that remains

120
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,589
is what exactly is the

121
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,050
operator norm of TG?

122
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:12,610
Do we have in fact an equality

123
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:14,250
sign here or is the

124
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:15,729
operator norm really less

125
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,869
than this integral?

126
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:19,119
In order to answer this question,

127
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,520
it's always good to look

128
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:22,250
at some examples because

129
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:23,610
then you get a lower bound

130
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:24,690
for the whole supreme.

131
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,089
And if you do that, you might

132
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,979
find that you also can use

133
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,850
the function G as an input.

134
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,669
However, then we can't use

135
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,479
this line here because

136
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,119
here we need that the supreme

137
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,479
norm of the function we put

138
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,940
in is exactly one.

139
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:40,360
But of course, you know,

140
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:41,750
we could change the function

141
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,300
G in such a way just by

142
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:44,529
dividing by the absolute

143
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:45,399
value of G.

144
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,330
So let's call this function

145
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:49,179
H and I also want to

146
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,729
add a complex conjugation

147
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,350
here which will be helpful

148
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,740
later.

149
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,070
Now it's easy to see the

150
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,789
supreme norm of age is

151
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,789
exactly one.

152
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,899
Now putting this function

153
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,770
into TG and looking

154
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:03,020
at the absolute value.

155
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,179
Then we know this has to

156
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,679
be less or equal than the

157
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,940
operator norm itself.

158
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:09,729
On the other hand, we know

159
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,940
this is the absolute value

160
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:12,500
of the integral where we

161
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:14,320
have to function G times

162
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:14,779
H.

163
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,820
And now you see why we added

164
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,700
the complex conjugation before

165
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,720
because now we have the absolute

166
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,679
value squared in the numerator,

167
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,320
we can omit the absolute

168
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,239
value outside because everything

169
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,200
is positive here.

170
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,799
And we also can just

171
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:30,709
cancel out one absolute value

172
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,440
of GT.

173
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,820
And then what remains is

174
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:35,440
exactly the same integral

175
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,200
as before.

176
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,329
And now we can put both

177
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:39,839
inequalities together and

178
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,459
find out that the operator

179
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,339
norm of the operator TG

180
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,700
is exactly this

181
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:45,480
integral.

182
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:46,359
OK.

183
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,269
So this was one quick example

184
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,700
of calculating the operator

185
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,510
norm of an operator between

186
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,709
two norm spaces.

187
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,559
In the next video, I want

188
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,459
to start talking about operators

189
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,890
between Hilbert spaces.

190
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,880
So thanks for listening.

191
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,209
Thanks for supporting me

192
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,600
and see you next time.

193
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:03,279
Bye.
