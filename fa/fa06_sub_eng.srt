00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,780
hello and welcome back to functional analysis and 
as always I want to thank all the nice people that

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:14,760
support the channel on study or PayPal today's 
part 6 finally is about Banner spaces we will

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,340
later see that a so-called Banner space is indeed 
one of the most important objects in functional

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:28,140
analysis in its core it's just a vector space but 
with more analytical structure on it in order to

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,980
understand such Banner space we first have to 
Define what enormous for this I will use the

6
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,420
letter F to denote a field of numbers however here 
it will always be the wheel or the complex numbers

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,660
of course this makes our life easier because we 
don't have to write down the definition two times

8
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,800
now we have a set X that also carries some 
operations such that it is a vector space

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,140
F Vector space always means that the scaling 
of vectors is done with numbers form f this

10
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,800
means if f is R you can scale with real numbers 
and in the case that f is C you can scale even

11
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:19,320
with complex numbers the usual visualization for 
points in a vector space is given by arrows it's

12
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,720
a good idea because you see the two operations 
scaling and adding two vectors immediately

13
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,680
however from the analytical point of view it would 
be also nice to know how long such an error is

14
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,660
measuring such length is what we 
call in the abstract sense and Norm

15
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,140
the symbol one uses for a norm are just two 
lines on the left and two lines on the right

16
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,380
and because we are measuring a length the only 
possible values should be non-negative numbers

17
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,160
this means that each Vector in X gets 
a number which is positive or zero

18
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,840
and this map we get we call a norm 
if it fulfills three properties

19
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,540
since you already know Matrix you might 
easily guess some of the details here

20
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,920
for example in a we find the positive definite 
part which means if we have the length 0

21
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,240
then this is equivalent for having the 
zero vector or in other words the zero

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,400
Vector has length 0 which makes sense 
but it's also the only one with length 0.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,140
now Part B explains what happens to the length 
when we scale a vector scaling here means we

24
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:41,760
have a vector X and multiply it from the 
left with a scalar so a number in F in the

25
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,460
picture you always visualize that with the arrow 
getting longer or smaller depending on Lambda

26
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:55,800
hence the norm has to satisfy this which means the 
length gets also multiplied by this Factor Lambda

27
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,240
however Lambda could be a negative number or 
even a complex one such that this only makes

28
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:10,380
sense if we consider the absolute value of Lambda 
now depending what f is r or C we have here the

29
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,900
absolute value in the real numbers or in the 
complex numbers therefore this part B now tells

30
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:23,100
you that the norm is always absolutely homogeneous 
so you can always pull out scalars but outside of

31
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:29,520
the norm they always get absolute values okay so 
we are in a vector space we have two operations

32
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,920
the scalar multiplication we had in B and now in C 
we have to explain what happens under the addition

33
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,880
so let's look at two vectors X and 
Y you already know how to visualize

34
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,980
the addition in a vector space you just put 
the two errors together to get out the sum

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,820
then you see the triangle here and you think 
that the length the norm should fulfill the

36
00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:00,420
normal geometry in this sense this means 
that it satisfies the triangle inequality

37
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,960
it looks similar what we have for the Matrix but 
keep in mind here's with respect to the vector

38
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:14,160
addition therefore the norm is not a linear map in 
general because you can pull out the addition but

39
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,820
what you get is only an inequality now you might 
already guess that a vector space together with a

40
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:27,600
chosen Norm gets a special name and you are white 
this pair is what we simply call a normed space

41
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,560
so what we have is a real or complex Vector space 
where we can measure the length in a meaningful

42
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,040
way now you might ask what is the connection 
to the Matrix basis we defined at the beginning

43
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,460
of this video series since the property A 
and C look very similar the norm could be

44
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,860
a special case of a metric indeed this one is 
an important fact you always should remember

45
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:01,020
if you have a norm for the vector Space X you can 
immediately Define a metric so maybe let's put the

46
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,960
norm in the index of the metric and then we can 
Define the distance between two points X and Y

47
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,740
if we look at the elements of the set X we 
should think of the end points of the errors

48
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,620
and then the distance between the two points 
should be given by the connection Vector which

49
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:28,140
is x minus y and then we take the length of it 
in fact this then defines a metric for the set X

50
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,640
this one is not hard to show 
I advise you to try it out

51
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,460
so proving the three properties of the metric 
by just using the three properties of the norm

52
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,780
now the most important thing to remember here is 
because we always have this definition in mind and

53
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:52,200
Norm space is indeed a special case of a metric 
space in particular all the definitions we have

54
00:05:52,200 --> 00:06:00,840
for metric spaces also work for Norm spaces so for 
example closeness openness and so on and with this

55
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,900
in mind we can now eventually Define what the 
banner space is so it could happen that our new

56
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:15,000
metric space here x d is a complete one this one 
is a very nice property which we discussed in the

57
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,460
last video all the crochet sequences converge we 
don't have holes in this metric space in this case

58
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:31,620
then the original Norm space acts with its Norm 
gets a special name we call it a banner space

59
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,580
okay so now you know the definition of one of 
the most important objects in functional analysis

60
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:46,200
so you see we have ingredients from the algebraic 
side and also from the analytical side on the one

61
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:52,800
hand we have a wheel or complex Vector space and 
on the other hand we have a complete metric space

62
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,740
and the thing that connects both 
sides very smoothly is our Norm

63
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,620
so please keep that in mind we don't have any 
metric here we have the metric that comes from

64
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:11,700
this Norm and by definition the norm can 
deal with the algebraic operations so this

65
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:18,480
is how I see a banner space in the abstract 
sense to get more concrete we will look at a

66
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:25,404
lot of examples in the next video so thanks for 
listening and I hope I see you there bye [Music]
