00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,780
hello and welcome back to functional analysis and 
as always I want to thank all the nice people that

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:14,760
support the channel on Steady or PayPal today's 
part 6 finally is about Banach spaces. We will

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,340
later see that a so-called Banach space is indeed 
one of the most important objects in functional

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:28,140
analysis. In its core it's just a vector space but 
with more analytical structure on it. In order to

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,980
understand such a Banach space we first have to 
define what a norm is. For this, I will use the

6
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,420
letter F to denote a field of numbers. However here 
it will always be the real or the complex numbers.

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,660
Of course, this makes our life easier because we 
don't have to write down the definition two times.

8
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,800
Now we have a set X that also carries some 
operations such that it is a vector space.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,140
F Vector space always means that the scaling 
of vectors is done with numbers form F. This

10
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,800
means if F is R you can scale with real numbers 
and in the case that F is C you can scale even

11
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:19,320
with complex numbers. The usual visualization for 
points in a vector space is given by arrows. It's

12
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,720
a good idea because you see the two operations 
scaling and adding two vectors immediately.

13
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,680
However from the analytical point of view it would 
be also nice to know how long such an arrow is.

14
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,660
Measuring such a length is what we 
call in the abstract sense and norm.

15
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,140
The symbol one uses for a norm are just two 
lines on the left and two lines on the right.

16
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,380
And because we are measuring a length, the only 
possible values should be non-negative numbers.

17
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,160
This means that each Vector in X gets 
a number which is positive or zero,

18
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,840
and this map we get we call a norm 
if it fulfills three properties.

19
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,540
Since you already know metrics you might 
easily guess some of the details here.

20
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,920
For example in (a) we find the positive definite 
part which means if we have the length 0,

21
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,240
then this is equivalent for having the 
zero vector, or in other words the zero

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,400
vector has length 0 (which makes sense)
but it's also the only one with length 0.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,140
Now Part (b) explains what happens to the length 
when we scale a vector. Scaling here means we

24
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:41,760
have a vector x and multiply it from the 
left with a scalar so a number in F. In the

25
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,460
picture you always visualize that with the arrow 
getting longer or smaller depending on Lambda.

26
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:55,800
Hence the norm has to satisfy this which means the 
length gets also multiplied by this Factor Lambda.

27
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,240
However Lambda could be a negative number or 
even a complex one such that this only makes

28
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:10,380
sense if we consider the absolute value of Lambda.
Now depending what F is, R or C, we have here the

29
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,900
absolute value in the real numbers or in the 
complex numbers. Therefore this part (b) now tells

30
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:23,100
you that the norm is always absolutely homogeneous.
So you can always pull out scalars but outside of

31
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:29,520
the norm they always get absolute values. Okay so 
we are in a vector space we have two operations

32
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,920
the scalar multiplication we had in (b) and now in (c) 
we have to explain what happens under the addition.

33
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,880
So let's look at two vectors x and 
y. You already know how to visualize

34
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,980
the addition in a vector space: you just put 
the two arrows together to get out the sum.

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,820
Then you see the triangle here and you think 
that the length the norm should fulfill the

36
00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:00,420
normal geometry in this sense this means 
that it satisfies the triangle inequality.

37
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,960
It looks similar what we have for the metrics but 
keep in mind here's with respect to the vector

38
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:14,160
addition. Therefore the norm is not a linear map in 
general because you can pull out the addition but

39
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,820
what you get is only an inequality. Now you might 
already guess that a vector space together with a

40
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:27,600
chosen norm gets a special name and you are right.
This pair is what we simply call a normed space.

41
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,560
So what we have is a real or complex vector space 
where we can measure the length in a meaningful

42
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,040
way. Now you might ask what is the connection 
to the metric spaces we defined at the beginning
s
43
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,460
of this video series. Since the property (a) 
and (c) look very similar, the norm could be

44
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,860
a special case of a metric. Indeed this one is 
an important fact you always should remember.

45
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:01,020
If you have a norm for the vector space X, you can 
immediately define a metric. So maybe let's put the

46
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,960
norm in the index of the metric and then we can 
define the distance between two points x and y.

47
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,740
If we look at the elements of the set X, we 
should think of the end points of the arrows,

48
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,620
and then the distance between the two points 
should be given by the connection vector which

49
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:28,140
is x minus y and then we take the length of it.
In fact, this then defines a metric for the set X.

50
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,640
This one is not hard to show.
I advise you to try it out.

51
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,460
So proving the three properties of the metric 
by just using the three properties of the norm.

52
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,780
Now the most important thing to remember here is 
because we always have this definition in mind and

53
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:52,200
a normed space is indeed a special case of a metric 
space. In particular all the definitions we have

54
00:05:52,200 --> 00:06:00,840
for metric spaces also work for normed spaces. So for 
example closedness, openness and so on. And with this

55
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,900
in mind we can now eventually define what a
Banach space is. So it could happen that our new

56
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:15,000
metric space here (X,d) is a complete one. This one 
is a very nice property which we discussed in the

57
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,460
last video. All the Cauchy sequences converge. We 
don't have holes in this metric space. In this case

58
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:31,620
then the original normed space, X with its norm,
gets a special name: we call it a Banach space.

59
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,580
Okay so now you know the definition of one of 
the most important objects in functional analysis.

60
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:46,200
So you see we have ingredients from the algebraic 
side and also from the analytical side. On the one

61
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:52,800
hand we have a real or complex vector space and 
on the other hand we have a complete metric space.

62
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,740
And the thing that connects both 
sides very smoothly is our norm.

63
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,620
So please keep that in mind we don't have any 
metric here we have the metric that comes from

64
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:11,700
this norm and by definition the norm can 
deal with the algebraic operations. So this

65
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:18,480
is how I see a Banach space in the abstract 
sense to get more concrete we will look at a

66
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:25,404
lot of examples in the next video so thanks for 
listening and I hope I see you there bye [Music]
