00:00:00,379 --> 00:00:02,240
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,619
 functional analysis.

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:05,480
 And as always, many thanks

4
00:00:05,489 --> 00:00:06,760
 to all the nice people that

5
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:08,279
 support this channel on study

6
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:09,119
 or paypal.

7
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,199
 This is part 26.

8
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:12,420
 And I still want to show

9
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,960
 you more main results in

10
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,680
 the topic of functional analysis.

11
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:17,790
 Today, we will talk about

12
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:19,450
 the so called open mapping

13
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:21,290
 theorem, also known as the

14
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:22,709
 Banach Schauder theorem.

15
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:25,010
 As the name suggests, the

16
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,620
 theorem is about open

17
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:27,290
 maps.

18
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:28,530
 Therefore, I first want to

19
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,170
 start explaining what an

20
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,920
 open map is the

21
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,549
 notion openness we define

22
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,860
 for metric spaces.

23
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,360
 So therefore, let's choose

24
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,099
 two metric spaces X and

25
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:38,520
 Y.

26
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:40,549
 Of course, now we want to

27
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,430
 consider a map from X

28
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,020
 to Y.

29
00:00:43,849 --> 00:00:45,630
 Now such a map F gets the

30
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:47,540
 name open if it sends

31
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:49,290
 open sets in X to

32
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,509
 open sets in Y.

33
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,369
 In other words, if we take

34
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,290
 any open set A in

35
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:56,959
 X, then the

36
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,759
 image F of A should

37
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,360
 also be an open set.

38
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:02,599
 However, please don't forget

39
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,540
 the notion openness is always

40
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,919
 given with respect to the

41
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,480
 corresponding metric space.

42
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:08,589
 OK.

43
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,220
 So this looks like a natural

44
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,819
 notion.

45
00:01:10,949 --> 00:01:12,290
 Therefore, let's immediately

46
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,669
 look at some examples.

47
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,660
 First, a very general example

48
00:01:16,669 --> 00:01:18,120
 because you might already

49
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:19,699
 recognize the connection

50
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:21,400
 to the definition of continuity

51
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:21,720
 here.

52
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,860
 So let's fix a bijective

53
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,370
 map, which means we have

54
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:27,120
 an inverse map F to the

55
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,410
 power minus one.

56
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,449
 Of course, this one now goes

57
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:32,220
 from Y to X and we

58
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,110
 also choose it to be a continuous

59
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,519
 map.

60
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,970
 Having these two assumptions.

61
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,830
 The map F from X to Y

62
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:40,610
 is indeed an open map.

63
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,029
 This is easy to see when

64
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,269
 you look at the definition

65
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,930
 of the continuity of the

66
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,709
 inverse map.

67
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,069
 It simply means when you

68
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,489
 have an open set on the right

69
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,239
 hand side, the pre image

70
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,779
 on the left hand side is

71
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,180
 also an open set.

72
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:56,860
 Of course, everything looks

73
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,300
 very similar here.

74
00:01:58,309 --> 00:01:59,589
 You see we have the inverse

75
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,519
 map from Y to X.

76
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:03,800
 Then we take a subset A in

77
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:05,419
 the space X which is on the

78
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,739
 right hand side of the inverse

79
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,220
 map.

80
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,339
 But on the left hand side

81
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,820
 in the picture, so don't

82
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,800
 get confused here.

83
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,270
 Then we go to the pre image

84
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,860
 which is here again denoted

85
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:16,419
 by the power minus one.

86
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,539
 OK.

87
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,520
 You could think this is an

88
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:20,220
 overload for a notation but

89
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:21,880
 indeed it fits together

90
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:23,660
 because this is simply

91
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:25,410
 the image of A and

92
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:25,839
 F.

93
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,759
 This comes from the 1 to

94
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,399
 1 correspondence we have

95
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,759
 by our bijective map

96
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,789
 F.

97
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,210
 Now with this example, you

98
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,919
 should see that the definition

99
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:36,440
 of an open map looks

100
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:37,770
 similar to the one of a

101
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:39,119
 continuous map.

102
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,380
 However, it's completely

103
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:41,970
 different because it goes

104
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:42,960
 the other way around.

105
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,220
 OK.

106
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:45,500
 Then let's write down some

107
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:47,039
 concrete examples of open

108
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:47,419
 maps.

109
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,639
 Maybe a simple example would

110
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:51,600
 be to look at a normal function

111
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,110
 between the real numbers.

112
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:55,320
 Of course R is just given

113
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,559
 with the standard metric,

114
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,699
 which means the absolute

115
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,309
 value.

116
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,279
 And I want to send X to

117
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:01,160
 X cubed.

118
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:03,639
 This has to be an open map

119
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:05,300
 because F is bijective

120
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,669
 and the inverse is

121
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:07,520
 continuous.

122
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,000
 In the same way, we can construct

123
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:11,130
 a counter example.

124
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:12,570
 Just look what happens when

125
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,100
 we send X to X

126
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,720
 squared.

127
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:16,490
 Of course, we can't use the

128
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,169
 general example here because

129
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:19,690
 it's simply not bijective

130
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,529
 but still it could be an

131
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:22,289
 open map.

132
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:24,009
 Of course, this is not the

133
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,899
 case, it's not an open map.

134
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,130
 As you can see when

135
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:28,850
 considering the open

136
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,679
 set as the open interval

137
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,169
 minus 2 to 2.

138
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,369
 Then the image is simply

139
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,100
 the interval 0 to

140
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,550
 4.

141
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,779
 And there you see this is

142
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:40,710
 not an open set in R

143
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:42,740
 Now with your new knowledge,

144
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,460
 what an open map is, we can

145
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,440
 finally state the open mapping

146
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:47,039
 theorem.

147
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,899
 The important ingredient

148
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,039
 you always should remember

149
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,699
 here is that we need Banach

150
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,300
 spaces on the left and the

151
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:54,179
 right hand side.

152
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:55,949
 So the completeness of the

153
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,699
 spaces is essential here.

154
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,119
 Now for bounded linear

155
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,100
 operator T, where I use the

156
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,380
 notation with the curved

157
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:05,070
 B again, we

158
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,289
 have that it is

159
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,270
 surjective

160
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,699
 if and only if

161
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,259
 T is an open map.

162
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,889
 And that is the famous

163
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:15,350
 open mapping theorem.

164
00:04:16,098 --> 00:04:17,759
 It just tells you that

165
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:19,778
 surjectivity for a linear

166
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,368
 bounded operator between

167
00:04:21,378 --> 00:04:23,229
 Banach spaces is a strong

168
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:25,158
 property because

169
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:26,928
 it implies the openness.

170
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,399
 Indeed, the implication from

171
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,040
 right to left is not so

172
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:32,600
 surprising and easy to

173
00:04:32,609 --> 00:04:34,549
 prove the actual work

174
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:36,109
 one has to do from the left

175
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:37,279
 to the right hand side.

176
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,130
 Therefore, the proof of the

177
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,779
 first implication is a good

178
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,880
 exercise for you.

179
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,450
 But for the other one, we

180
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:44,790
 need a whole other video.

181
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,970
 However, before we do that,

182
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,670
 I want to use the next video

183
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,170
 to show you an important

184
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:51,910
 consequence of the open mapping

185
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,570
 theorem.

186
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,410
 It's called the bounded

187
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,709
 inverse theorem.

188
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:57,730
 Hence please watch the next

189
00:04:57,739 --> 00:04:59,609
 video because this consequence

190
00:04:59,619 --> 00:05:01,429
 is very important in a lot

191
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,359
 of applications.

192
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,510
 So have a nice day and see

193
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:04,989
 you then.

194
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,750
 Bye.
