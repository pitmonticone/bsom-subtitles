00:00:00,449 --> 00:00:02,269
Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:03,490
functional analysis.

3
00:00:03,559 --> 00:00:04,670
And as always, I want to

4
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:06,099
thank all the nice people

5
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,269
that support this channel

6
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,779
on Steady or paypal.

7
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:11,140
Today we have part seven

8
00:00:11,149 --> 00:00:12,829
where we discuss examples

9
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,060
of Banach spaces.

10
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:16,040
Please recall the picture

11
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,299
from the last time where

12
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:18,450
we learned that the Banach

13
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:19,969
space is on the one hand,

14
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:21,340
a real or complex vector

15
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:21,920
space.

16
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,170
And on the other hand, a

17
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,920
complete metric space where

18
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,659
the connection is given by

19
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,280
the norm.

20
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:29,899
Of course, now we can find

21
00:00:29,909 --> 00:00:31,420
a lot of examples.

22
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:33,419
Let's start with the simplest

23
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,139
one, you can just consider

24
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,380
the real number line.

25
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,860
Therefore, we already know

26
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:40,840
it's a one dimensional real

27
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:41,720
vector space.

28
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,919
And we also know that we

29
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,459
can calculate lengths

30
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,180
if we consider the absolute

31
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:48,799
value in the real numbers.

32
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,819
Indeed with our

33
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,400
definition, this is a

34
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:54,400
norm and then

35
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:56,180
you should know the associated

36
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,959
metric is given by this

37
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:58,599
formula.

38
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:00,909
And that's just the normal

39
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:02,349
metric we have in the real

40
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:02,930
numbers.

41
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,319
And now from real analysis,

42
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,809
you should know that all

43
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:08,699
the Cauchy sequences indeed

44
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:09,980
converge in R.

45
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,760
In other words, are together

46
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:14,180
with this norm is a Bana

47
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:14,989
space.

48
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,519
So this is our first.

49
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:19,129
And as you can see a very

50
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:20,209
simple example,

51
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:22,290
however, we can consider

52
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,910
even a simple example.

53
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,059
And you might already guess

54
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:27,410
instead of a one dimensional

55
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:28,980
vector space, we choose a

56
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,699
zero dimensional vector space.

57
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,900
This means that the zero

58
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,769
vector is the only vector

59
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:35,430
in the space.

60
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:37,760
And of course, there's only

61
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:39,699
one norm we can define

62
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:41,569
here because the zero

63
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,410
vector has to have length

64
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:43,930
zero.

65
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,300
Hence everything we need

66
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:47,569
here is fulfilled.

67
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:48,889
We have a Banach space.

68
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:51,430
Of course, this is a very

69
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,160
boring one and not very

70
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:53,779
helpful.

71
00:01:54,589 --> 00:01:56,080
Indeed, often it's a

72
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:58,019
pathological one which means

73
00:01:58,029 --> 00:01:59,730
that some theorem we prove

74
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:01,680
later for Banach spaces will

75
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,260
not hold for this particular

76
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:03,739
one here.

77
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,050
Please keep that in mind

78
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,489
if you want to use the zero

79
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,449
Banach space as your example.

80
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,820
However, now let's continue

81
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,300
with one of the most important

82
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:14,059
examples.

83
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,889
This is the LP space written

84
00:02:16,899 --> 00:02:18,190
as LP

85
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,330
NF

86
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:21,729
and denotes the natural numbers

87
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,130
and F is our field.

88
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:25,070
So the real or complex numbers

89
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,339
and P is a real number

90
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,960
greater or equal than one,

91
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,740
but it could also be infinity.

92
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,339
However, infinity is a special

93
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,699
case we consider later.

94
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,600
So here I exclude it.

95
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,020
Now, as I said, this

96
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:40,949
LPN F is defined

97
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,509
as all the sequences in

98
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,470
F that fulfill one condition.

99
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:46,690
So you immediately see the

100
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,009
notation here makes sense.

101
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,610
This is the domain and this

102
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:51,009
is the co domain for the

103
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,729
map given by the sequence.

104
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,899
And Now this condition is

105
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,559
given by the series where

106
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,039
you add up all the sequence

107
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,960
members and we do it in the

108
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,720
absolute value and to the

109
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:02,589
power P.

110
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,080
And if this series now

111
00:03:05,089 --> 00:03:06,960
converges, which means it's

112
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,399
less than infinity, then

113
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,990
the sequence is an LP.

114
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:12,449
Often from the context, it's

115
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,630
clear if we are dealing with

116
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,229
real or complex numbers and

117
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,789
what the index set of the

118
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,820
sequences is.

119
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,520
And therefore one just writes

120
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:20,860
LP in this case.

121
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:23,029
Now, the first thing you

122
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,440
should note is that if we

123
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:25,869
ignore this condition and

124
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,649
just consider the sequences,

125
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,559
then they form a vector space

126
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,009
because adding and scaling

127
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,729
is just given in a component

128
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,529
wise sense.

129
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,750
Therefore, here we just have

130
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,410
to show that LP is a

131
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,279
subspace of this bigger vector

132
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:40,779
space.

133
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,729
However, what we also want

134
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,229
is a norm for this vector

135
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,100
space and

136
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,710
usually one just uses a

137
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,369
P as an index.

138
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,550
Now if we give the whole

139
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:54,199
sequence, the name X,

140
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,350
then we can calculate

141
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,190
the P norm of X

142
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,130
by using this number because

143
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,419
we know it's finite.

144
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:03,130
However, you might already

145
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:04,460
see that the second property

146
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,729
of a norm is not fulfilled.

147
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,559
In this case, we also need

148
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,110
the PEF root outside.

149
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,910
If you set P equals to two,

150
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,380
you will recognize something

151
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:15,039
similar to the Euclidean

152
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,160
norm in RD.

153
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,630
Indeed, with similar arguments,

154
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,260
we can show that this now

155
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,459
gives us a norm.

156
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,739
I emphasize that this is

157
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,200
not trivial to show that.

158
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,850
And indeed, I skip that here,

159
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:28,059
but we will do it later

160
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,470
here.

161
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,579
In this video, I want to

162
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:32,549
focus how we get the completeness

163
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:33,339
of the space.

164
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,589
Hence, our claim is

165
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,109
LP together with this

166
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,899
norm is a Banach space.

167
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,980
The first part of the proof

168
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,910
has to be that LP is an F

169
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,700
vector space and that this

170
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:46,589
P norm is indeed a norm

171
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,079
on it.

172
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:49,239
I already told you we don't

173
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:49,839
do it here.

174
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,549
We assume it, we will prove

175
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:52,089
it later.

176
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:53,769
That's just because we need

177
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:55,239
a lot of technical details

178
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:55,959
for this.

179
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:57,779
And I think it will distract

180
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,429
us from the important completeness

181
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,679
part of the proof here.

182
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:02,559
Now, in order to show the

183
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,070
completeness, we have to

184
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,720
choose an arbitrary

185
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,839
Cauchy sequence.

186
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,079
So this might be hard to

187
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:09,600
understand.

188
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,600
Now the queen X is

189
00:05:11,609 --> 00:05:13,410
a sequence in F and

190
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,920
now we have to consider

191
00:05:14,929 --> 00:05:16,380
sequences of

192
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,200
sequences.

193
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:19,230
Therefore, I choose here

194
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:21,149
an upper index K to

195
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,149
denote the different sequences

196
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,029
we have in our Cauchy sequence.

197
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,579
And now we have to show that

198
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:29,160
all the sequences here in

199
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,149
a row converge to another

200
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,410
sequence, a limit.

201
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:33,989
OK?

202
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,519
To get the right idea, let's

203
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:37,470
write down some of the sequences.

204
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,970
So here you see our Cauchy

205
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,470
sequence which goes from

206
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,320
top to bottom.

207
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,859
Now, for example, our X one

208
00:05:44,869 --> 00:05:46,290
is a sequence in LP.

209
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,079
So it consists of real or

210
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:49,630
complex numbers in a row.

211
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,350
And the same we can write

212
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:53,209
down for X two X three and

213
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,709
so on.

214
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,500
Now, if you look at this

215
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,230
picture, you see a lot of

216
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:59,109
numbers in F in two different

217
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:00,799
directions from left to

218
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:02,500
right and from top to bottom.

219
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:04,970
And please keep in mind in

220
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,929
the end, we want the limit

221
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,010
here on the left.

222
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,459
In order to find this, we

223
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,799
can just look at the different

224
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:13,640
sequences we have here from

225
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:14,549
top to bottom.

226
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,989
So maybe you just take the

227
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,529
fourth column here and then

228
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,890
we look at the difference

229
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:21,369
between two members of the

230
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,010
sequence.

231
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,470
So maybe we use K

232
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,559
and L for the corresponding

233
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,170
index.

234
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,489
Now we want to put in the

235
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,230
information we already have,

236
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,910
which means we consider here

237
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,079
the absolute value to the

238
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:35,010
power of P.

239
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,420
And then we know this is

240
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,220
less or equal than

241
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,570
summing up all other

242
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:41,480
possibilities.

243
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,809
That just means that we have

244
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,529
here all the other

245
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,549
columns as well.

246
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,519
Of course, we do that because

247
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:51,269
here we have our P

248
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,579
norm to the power P

249
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,119
and there we find our original

250
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,600
sequences again where we

251
00:06:56,609 --> 00:06:58,320
know that they form a Cauchy

252
00:06:58,329 --> 00:06:58,920
sequence.

253
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:01,200
Don't worry, I'll remind

254
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:02,690
you what it means to be a

255
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,750
Cauchy sequence here.

256
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,209
For all epsilon greater zero,

257
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,950
we find an index and

258
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,209
maybe we call it capital

259
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,070
K such that

260
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,149
for all indices

261
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,750
afterwards K and

262
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,679
L we have that

263
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,799
the distance between two

264
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:18,679
members here is less than

265
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,350
epsilon.

266
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,390
Now, if you look at the inequality

267
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,220
above, you see that this

268
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,200
thing here is always greater

269
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:27,279
than just looking at the

270
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,119
absolute value in one column.

271
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,279
Let's put that in here.

272
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,959
And then you can see this

273
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,799
sequence here of normal

274
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:36,070
numbers in F.

275
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,670
So this column here is

276
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:39,500
also a Cauchy sequence in

277
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,940
F.

278
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:42,390
The value is just the normal

279
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,540
norm in F.

280
00:07:43,549 --> 00:07:44,559
So the real numbers or the

281
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,399
complex numbers.

282
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,390
And we already discussed

283
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,880
this in the first example,

284
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:50,399
this is a Banach space.

285
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,119
In other words, this

286
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,540
sequence has a limit

287
00:07:55,429 --> 00:07:56,609
and a suitable name should

288
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:58,589
be x tilde with an index

289
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,010
four.

290
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,910
And this limit in F is what

291
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,829
we find if we go from top

292
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,410
to bottom in the fourth

293
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,109
column, of

294
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,450
course, the four was just

295
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:09,250
an example.

296
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,029
You can do all the things

297
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,350
here with another column

298
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:12,940
as well.

299
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,510
So we can introduce an

300
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,100
index M for example,

301
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,079
and then I can change it

302
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:19,500
here everywhere.

303
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,899
Now, this means for all the

304
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,320
columns here, we find the

305
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:25,100
corresponding limit X till

306
00:08:25,109 --> 00:08:26,739
the M we have here at the

307
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,200
bottom.

308
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,850
So indeed, what we get here

309
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:31,540
on the right is a new

310
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:33,159
sequence with numbers in

311
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:33,549
F.

312
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,140
Of course, we can and we

313
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,429
should give it the name X

314
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:38,969
tilde, but we don't know

315
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:40,530
yet if it's the limit here

316
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,359
on the left.

317
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,669
This is what we still have

318
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,408
to show now.

319
00:08:45,369 --> 00:08:45,760
OK.

320
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,659
So the plan is to show that

321
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,659
XK minus X tilde

322
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,619
in the P norm goes to zero.

323
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,599
Or in other words, for an

324
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:55,489
arbitrary epsilon, this should

325
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,929
be smaller than epsilon.

326
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,119
OK.

327
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,299
So then let's write down

328
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:00,229
the P norm again.

329
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:02,729
So we have this series and

330
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:04,309
we need the P food again.

331
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,590
But it's easier to write

332
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:06,479
the power of P.

333
00:09:06,489 --> 00:09:07,390
On the other side.

334
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,559
This just means that we used

335
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,469
to p-th root just in the end.

336
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,400
The first idea now would

337
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:15,090
be to push the limit process

338
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:15,940
here outside.

339
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,909
So we write the limit of

340
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,219
N to infinity.

341
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,530
So you see it's completely

342
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:22,159
the same.

343
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:23,710
But now we can discuss this

344
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:25,359
finite sum here on the right.

345
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,580
However, we know that this

346
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,039
X till the N is

347
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:30,239
also a limit.

348
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,280
Hence, we can push that limit

349
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:34,260
out as well because the absolute

350
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,989
value is a continuous function

351
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,119
and we just have a finite

352
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:37,679
sum here.

353
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,830
Now, if you look back, you

354
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,460
will see that this thing

355
00:09:41,469 --> 00:09:42,969
here is what we can keep

356
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:44,729
as small as we want.

357
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:46,900
We use again that we have

358
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:48,320
here the property of the

359
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,349
Cauchy sequence.

360
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,659
Therefore, for our given

361
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:53,400
epsilon, we choose our capital

362
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:55,140
K such that we have this

363
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,799
at this point.

364
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:58,080
In the proof, we can't know

365
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,640
how small this really should

366
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,099
be.

367
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:01,559
Therefore, to be careful,

368
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,229
maybe we introduce an epsilon

369
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:05,080
prime and define it later

370
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:05,469
on.

371
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,599
Now, what we know from above

372
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:09,599
is that this whole thing

373
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,609
is less than epsilon prime

374
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:12,559
to the power P

375
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,330
as long as K and L

376
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,760
are bigger than the capital

377
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,219
K.

378
00:10:17,229 --> 00:10:18,539
It's the same reasoning as

379
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:18,900
here.

380
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:20,679
OK.

381
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,979
So this is good information

382
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,799
for us because it tells you

383
00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:24,789
we have here the nonne

384
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,880
numbers that are bounded

385
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,679
from above by this constant,

386
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,640
of course, then comes some

387
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,710
limit process.

388
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,309
But we know in the worst

389
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,869
case, this limit is

390
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,599
exactly this upper bound.

391
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:39,320
So in summary, we know for

392
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,859
all K greater or capital

393
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:42,739
K, this whole thing

394
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,609
is less or equal

395
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:45,780
than epsilon prime to the

396
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:46,580
power P.

397
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,869
And now is the point to take

398
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,380
the pea food because we get

399
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,119
rid of these two peas.

400
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:54,710
And now to get to the correct

401
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,349
result, we need epsilon prime

402
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,229
to be less than epsilon itself,

403
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,109
which means we can define

404
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,909
epsilon prime, for example,

405
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,390
as epsilon half.

406
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,599
And now in the end, you can

407
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,150
put everything together for

408
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,840
an abitrary chosen epsilon

409
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:10,169
greater zero, you find a

410
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:12,049
capital K such that for

411
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:13,950
all indices after the capital

412
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,380
K, you find the

413
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,940
inequality here, the

414
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,489
distance between XK

415
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,359
minus X tilde is less

416
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:22,349
than epsilon and there we

417
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:23,830
have it X tilde is

418
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,469
indeed the limit of

419
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:27,190
XK with respect to the

420
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,619
p-norm.

421
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:30,299
The only thing missing is

422
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:32,090
the explanation why X tilde

423
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:33,539
is also an element in

424
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:34,130
LP.

425
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:36,289
However, this now follows

426
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:38,090
from all we know we know

427
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:39,650
here that the difference

428
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:40,729
is an LP.

429
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,669
And we also know that XK

430
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,570
is an LP.

431
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,669
Therefore, if you write X

432
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,049
tilde in this way, which

433
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:48,969
means you subtract XK and

434
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:49,760
add it again.

435
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:51,729
Then you see the linear combination,

436
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,609
which means here's one part

437
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:56,539
in LP and here's one

438
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,530
part in LP.

439
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,159
Hence also the sum is an

440
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:02,070
LP because we are dealing

441
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,179
with a vector space.

442
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:05,239
That's the part of the proof

443
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,409
at the beginning where we

444
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:07,539
skip the details.

445
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:08,780
But here we can use it.

446
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,049
Of course, we will discuss

447
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:12,690
this even further in upcoming

448
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,489
videos.

449
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,979
But at this point, I really

450
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:16,830
wanted to show you an important

451
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:18,549
and non trivial example of

452
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,349
a Banach space.

453
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,599
OK?

454
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:21,580
I hope I see you in the next

455
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,369
videos where I first explain

456
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,869
more concepts in functional

457
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,580
analysis.

458
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,099
And afterwards we go into

459
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:28,940
more details for examples.

460
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,440
So thanks for listening and

461
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,210
see you later.

462
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:32,859
Bye.
