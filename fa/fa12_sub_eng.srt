00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,269
Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:03,569
functional analysis

3
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:05,719
and many, many thanks to

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,179
all my great supporters on

5
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,390
Steady and paypal.

6
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:10,029
You really give me the motivation

7
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:11,829
to put all this work in making

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,810
these videos.

9
00:00:12,819 --> 00:00:14,770
So thanks a lot in

10
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:15,800
functional analysis.

11
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,159
We've already reached part

12
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:17,629
12.

13
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,329
And today we will talk about

14
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,479
continuity

15
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,549
to be more precise.

16
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,309
We will talk about continuity

17
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:25,709
for metric spaces.

18
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,069
For this, we just need two

19
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,209
metric spaces.

20
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:30,809
So one set X with a

21
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:32,790
metric d_X and a set

22
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,250
Y with a metric d_Y.

23
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,080
And now we consider a map

24
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,840
from X to Y.

25
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,779
And now such a map is called

26
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,810
continuous.

27
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,389
If the preimages of

28
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,299
open sets are always

29
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,819
open more

30
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,080
concretely, we would write

31
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,709
the preimage of a set

32
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,020
B in Y.

33
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,130
So now this usually denotes

34
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,580
the preimage of B but I

35
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,509
want to make that really

36
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,049
clear.

37
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,529
So I want to use brackets

38
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:00,840
here.

39
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:03,520
I think that's helpful because

40
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:05,190
every time you see the brackets,

41
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,489
you know this is not the

42
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,910
inverse map, it's the pre

43
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,430
image.

44
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:09,919
OK.

45
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,559
Now we say this set is

46
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:13,080
open in

47
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:14,760
X for

48
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:16,739
any open set B in

49
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,540
Y OK.

50
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,379
So this is the former definition.

51
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,639
And now I can give you a

52
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,300
picture to remember it.

53
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,519
So we have our metric space

54
00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:26,849
X on the left hand side,

55
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,900
on the right hand side, we

56
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,379
have our metric space Y.

57
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,069
And in between, we have the

58
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,720
map.

59
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,389
Now, for any open set

60
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,779
B in Y,

61
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,040
we find the corresponding

62
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,540
preimage on the left hand

63
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:39,940
side.

64
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,480
Now the property continuous

65
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:44,000
means that if you start with

66
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,419
an open set here, you'll

67
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,019
also get an open set here

68
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,919
by thinking about boundary

69
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,339
points.

70
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:50,980
This means that if you don't

71
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:52,199
have any boundary points

72
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:53,940
in this set, you also don't

73
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:55,250
have any boundary points

74
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,059
in this set.

75
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,709
In fact, you can also read

76
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,519
that from left to right

77
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:01,209
by looking here at an input

78
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,309
and you change the input

79
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,099
a little bit by a small distance.

80
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,230
You know, this is always

81
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,699
possible because you are

82
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:08,589
in an open set.

83
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:10,458
And then you know, on the

84
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:12,378
right hand side, the output

85
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:13,968
is also only changed

86
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:15,289
inside this open set.

87
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,669
Of course, this notion seems

88
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,770
a little bit abstract.

89
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:19,979
Therefore, now we look at

90
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,770
something we call sequentially

91
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:22,550
continuous.

92
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,000
As the name tells you this

93
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:26,250
has something to do with

94
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:27,300
sequences.

95
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:29,259
In some sense, I can repeat

96
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,820
what I told you before we

97
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,479
choose any output on the

98
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,380
left hand side.

99
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,639
And let's call it X tilde.

100
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:38,619
And also let's look at any

101
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,479
sequence XN that

102
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,039
converges to X tilde.

103
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,350
And then it should hold that

104
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,059
the new sequence F of

105
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,869
XN is convergent

106
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,339
to F of X tilde.

107
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,720
In other words, every

108
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:52,940
convergence sequence on the

109
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:54,300
left hand side gets

110
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:56,080
translated into a convergence

111
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:56,520
sequence.

112
00:02:56,529 --> 00:02:57,699
On the right hand side,

113
00:02:58,449 --> 00:02:59,860
you might already guess for

114
00:02:59,869 --> 00:03:01,039
us, it might be easier to

115
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,820
work with the notion sequentially

116
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,679
continuous because we just

117
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,960
have to deal with sequences

118
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,279
there.

119
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,339
Now, the good thing is that

120
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,179
for metric spaces, both

121
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,740
terms mean indeed the same

122
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,130
thing.

123
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,740
In other words, one can prove

124
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,580
that they are in fact equivalent.

125
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:18,550
For that reason, we will

126
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:20,369
simply use the word continuous

127
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,929
but often mean this

128
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,759
characterization with sequences.

129
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,889
However, I wanted to show

130
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:27,649
you both definitions because

131
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,190
if you don't work in magic

132
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:29,889
spaces.

133
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:31,669
But in general topological

134
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,309
spaces in general,

135
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,720
both notions are not

136
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:35,429
equivalent.

137
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,759
OK.

138
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,160
So I write down the fact

139
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:40,160
and then we can look at examples.

140
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,199
OK, maybe you already know

141
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,440
a lot of examples.

142
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,080
So let's look at some simple

143
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:45,619
ones.

144
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,190
The first one would be choosing

145
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,630
XDX as the

146
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,110
discrete metric space.

147
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,649
So where X is any non

148
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,429
empty set?

149
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,339
Now, on the right hand side,

150
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,419
it does not matter which

151
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:58,580
metric space we choose.

152
00:03:58,589 --> 00:04:00,490
So let's say it's any metric

153
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:00,940
space.

154
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:03,330
Now let's look at the map

155
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:05,259
F from X to Y.

156
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:07,720
And then we can conclude

157
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:09,520
that this one has to be

158
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:10,320
continuous.

159
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,669
This is simply the case because

160
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,039
all subsets in a

161
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,040
discrete metric space are

162
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:16,709
open sets.

163
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,839
This means that checking

164
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,608
the definition of continuity

165
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,089
is immediately given here.

166
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,540
So keep that in mind, whenever

167
00:04:24,549 --> 00:04:25,790
you see a discrete metric

168
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,299
space on the left hand side,

169
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,500
now another general example,

170
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,260
like this would be to consider

171
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:32,440
a constant function.

172
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,429
For this, we can choose X

173
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,950
and Y as general metric

174
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,640
spaces and then

175
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,070
fix A Y zero.

176
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:39,720
And Y.

177
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,179
In this case, then we

178
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,899
know that the map

179
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,540
F that sends all the

180
00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:47,260
X to Y zero

181
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,059
is always continuous.

182
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:51,250
Indeed, this is what you

183
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,549
see immediately by looking

184
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,220
at the definition of sequentially

185
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,010
continuous.

186
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,910
Simply by looking at this

187
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,309
part where you know this

188
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,670
is always fulfilled.

189
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,670
The left hand side is always

190
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:02,410
Y zero.

191
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,790
The right hand side is always

192
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:04,429
Y zero.

193
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,209
So we stay at the limit point

194
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,089
for all N OK.

195
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,269
With this in mind, let's

196
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,040
go to two other examples.

197
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:12,559
I find very important

198
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,820
for the first example, I

199
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:16,679
want to look at a norm space.

200
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:18,549
Of course, we always have

201
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:19,950
the induced metric space

202
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,440
in mind.

203
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:23,170
And Y should be just R

204
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,700
with the standard metric

205
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:26,239
given by the absolute value?

206
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,339
And now the map I want to

207
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,059
consider is F given

208
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,700
by X to R

209
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:33,760
where an element X is

210
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:35,299
sent to the norm of

211
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:35,839
X.

212
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:38,140
And now our claim is that

213
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:39,799
is always continuous.

214
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,260
OK.

215
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:42,459
So for this, let's write

216
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,339
down a proof.

217
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,980
So we check that the map

218
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:46,320
is indeed sequentially

219
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:47,059
continuous.

220
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,559
Hence let XN be a

221
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,290
sequence in X with

222
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:53,019
limit point X tilde.

223
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,380
And then we look what happens

224
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,980
when we apply the map F.

225
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,619
Of course, F of XN is just

226
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,579
by definition the norm of

227
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:02,100
XN.

228
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,410
Now we have to bring in the

229
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,109
limit point because that's

230
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:07,489
the only thing we know about

231
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,070
the sequence, it has a limit.

232
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,570
So what I do is subtract

233
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,119
the limit and add it again.

234
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,779
So we add a zero here

235
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,600
inside the norm, we

236
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,489
do that because then we

237
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,730
can apply the triangle

238
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:20,529
inequality.

239
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,299
So I write X and minus

240
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:23,839
X tilde in the norm

241
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,529
plus the norm of XT.

242
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,140
And then we know the first

243
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:29,529
part is just the distance

244
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,239
between XN and X

245
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:31,700
tilde.

246
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,779
And the second part is just

247
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,970
F of X tilde.

248
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,549
By assumption we now know

249
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:38,730
that the distance between

250
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:40,640
XN and X tilde goes to

251
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:42,260
zero when N goes to

252
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:42,959
infinity.

253
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,220
Hence doing a limit on both

254
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:45,679
sides.

255
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,140
We get that the limit of

256
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:48,910
F of XN is less or

257
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,559
equal than F of X til

258
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:51,959
OK.

259
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,339
So you see that's already

260
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,450
half of the work we have

261
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:54,920
to do.

262
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,380
So now let's go from the

263
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,779
other side and show the other

264
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,619
inequality.

265
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:00,209
Therefore, we start with

266
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,989
F of X tilde, which is just

267
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,579
the norm of X tilde

268
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,609
doing a similar thing than

269
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:07,160
before we just put in

270
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,239
XN.

271
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,959
So subtracting and adding

272
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,660
again, of course,

273
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,179
now we doing the triangle

274
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,179
inequality gives us X tilde

275
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,690
the minus XN in the

276
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,450
norm plus the norm of

277
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:21,239
XN, which is a

278
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,820
similar result as before

279
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:24,660
because we have XT the

280
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,149
XN in the metric

281
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,769
plus F of

282
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:28,250
XN.

283
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:29,989
Now, I don't have to tell

284
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,309
you applying the limit on

285
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,109
both sides.

286
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,829
We get the inequality the

287
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,589
other way around.

288
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:36,720
And with that, our proof

289
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,130
is finished because we have

290
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,799
shown that the sequence F

291
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:41,790
of XN converges

292
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,279
with respect to the metric

293
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,170
in R to F of X tilde.

294
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,649
So we conclude the norm is

295
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,309
always a continuous map.

296
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,410
OK.

297
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,700
So you might guess with the

298
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:53,329
next example, we go to an

299
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,410
inner product space.

300
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,579
So let's choose X as an inner

301
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:58,130
product space where we already

302
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,910
know it's also a metric

303
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,470
space.

304
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:02,369
And why should we just the

305
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,089
complex numbers with the

306
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,709
standard metric given by

307
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,649
the absolute value?

308
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,239
Now, since an inner product

309
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,700
has two entries, I want to

310
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:11,209
fix the first one with a

311
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,670
given X zero.

312
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,730
Now the map we consider is

313
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:16,570
F defined from X to

314
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,079
Y.

315
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:18,799
So C and the

316
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:20,630
vector X is sent to the inner

317
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,549
product X zero with

318
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:23,079
X.

319
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,279
And the claim is again, this

320
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,200
map is a continuous one.

321
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:29,679
As before, I really want

322
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,910
to show you a proof of this

323
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,510
statement.

324
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,109
Of course, the procedure

325
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:34,400
should be the same as before

326
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,919
we consider any point X

327
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,659
tilde and a sequence that

328
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,099
is convergent to this point.

329
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,030
However, now, maybe we can

330
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,929
do it in one step when considering

331
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,739
the absolute value of F of

332
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,729
XN minus F of X

333
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:47,150
tilde.

334
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:49,010
In other words, this is the

335
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,469
inner product X zero with

336
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:52,340
XN and X zero with

337
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:54,280
X tilde using

338
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:55,609
the linearity, we can put

339
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,219
that together.

340
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:57,510
So we have just one in a

341
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,119
product.

342
00:08:58,849 --> 00:09:00,270
Now, every time you see something

343
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,630
like that, you know, you

344
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,270
can apply Cauchy Schwarz,

345
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,159
this means that we have the

346
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,099
inequality I will abbreviate

347
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:08,229
with CS

348
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,159
and it tells us we have the

349
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:11,760
norm of X zero times the

350
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,460
norm of XN minus

351
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,260
X tilde.

352
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,179
Since this last part is the

353
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,890
distance between XN and X

354
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,820
tilde, we know this goes

355
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,320
to zero when N goes to

356
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:21,979
infinity.

357
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,090
Moreover, the whole right

358
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:25,650
hand side goes to zero

359
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:27,239
when N goes to infinity.

360
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,260
In conclusion, also the left

361
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,030
hand side goes to zero because

362
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,359
it was non negative from

363
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:32,940
the beginning.

364
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,479
And then we know the sequence

365
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:37,440
FX N converges to F

366
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,150
of X til

367
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,469
OK.

368
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,809
So we have shown that the

369
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,450
inner product is a continuous

370
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,070
map in the second argument.

371
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,070
And by symmetry or using

372
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,359
the same argument as here,

373
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:48,719
we can also show that it

374
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:50,239
is a continuous map in the

375
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,280
first argument.

376
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:52,859
This is important to know

377
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:54,039
for a lot of proofs we will

378
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:54,960
do in the future.

379
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:56,109
And I'll show you one.

380
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:58,000
Now indeed,

381
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,130
this is the cliffhanger from

382
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,960
the last video.

383
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:01,039
So we have an inner product

384
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:02,840
space and a subset U

385
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,090
and then U perp the orthogonal

386
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:06,630
complement of U

387
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,559
is always a close subset

388
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,549
proving this is not hard

389
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,280
at all because now we know

390
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:13,500
all the things we need.

391
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,559
Now please recall part four

392
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,000
of the series where I

393
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,789
described close sets with

394
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,919
the help of sequences.

395
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,700
So what we have to do is

396
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,059
choose a sequence in the

397
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,760
set itself where we know

398
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,900
it's convergent.

399
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:27,640
But first just in the space

400
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,570
X, now when we can

401
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,169
show that the limit X tilde

402
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:33,130
is also in U perp then

403
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,770
we know U perp is closed.

404
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:35,799
OK.

405
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:37,239
So now we just have to use

406
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,700
the definition of U perp

407
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:41,020
which means that inner product

408
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,940
of XN with U is

409
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,590
always zero, no matter

410
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:45,840
which U we choose.

411
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,739
Since this equation holds

412
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,400
for all N, we can look at

413
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:51,039
the limit and know this is

414
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:51,940
also zero.

415
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,500
And now we know we can pull

416
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,059
in the limit here because

417
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,900
this is just the continuity

418
00:10:57,909 --> 00:10:59,859
of the map G we stated before.

419
00:11:00,739 --> 00:11:02,210
In other words, we just have

420
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:04,030
X tilde with U is equal to

421
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:04,530
zero.

422
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,390
And since this holds for

423
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,340
all u in U, you see

424
00:11:08,349 --> 00:11:09,739
this is just the definition

425
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,669
of U perp X tilde is

426
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,830
also in U perp.

427
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,669
And this is exactly what

428
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,469
we wanted to show the a formal

429
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:17,950
complement is always a

430
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,820
close set.

431
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:21,349
And you have seen this immediately

432
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:22,919
comes from the continuity

433
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:23,989
of the inner product.

434
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,200
OK?

435
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,159
I think that's good enough

436
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:26,700
for today.

437
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,260
Thank you very much for listening

438
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,210
and please check out the

439
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:31,179
PDFs if you want of

440
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,130
course, I hope I see you

441
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,659
next time when we go further

442
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:34,950
into the topic of functional

443
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,710
analysis.

444
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,849
So have a nice day and see

445
00:11:37,859 --> 00:11:38,340
you then.

446
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:38,940
Bye.
