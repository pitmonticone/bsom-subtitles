00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,200
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,730
 functional analysis.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,489
 And there's always many,

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,889
 many thanks to all the nice

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,949
 people that support this

6
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,779
 channel on Steady or paypal.

7
00:00:10,329 --> 00:00:10,729
 Today.

8
00:00:10,739 --> 00:00:12,520
 In part 28 we will talk

9
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:14,220
 about the spectrum of a bounded

10
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:14,880
 operator.

11
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:17,049
 The spectrum comes in as

12
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,639
 a generalization for the

13
00:00:18,909 --> 00:00:20,200
 eigenvalues of a matrix.

14
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,229
 For this.

15
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:22,840
 Please recall when we have

16
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,209
 a square matrix A

17
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,469
 which means we have N rows

18
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:28,440
 and N columns and the entries

19
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,760
 can come from the complex

20
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,319
 numbers.

21
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:32,580
 Then we are able to talk

22
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,069
 about the eigenvalues of

23
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,290
 a.

24
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:36,330
 In particular, we call a

25
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,290
 complex number lambda an

26
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:39,119
 eigenvalue.

27
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,669
 If we find a corresponding

28
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,419
 eigenvector more

29
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,900
 concretely, this means there

30
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:46,779
 exists a vector X

31
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,509
 which is not the zero vector

32
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,580
 and it fulfills that

33
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,340
 AX is equal to

34
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:53,130
 lambda X.

35
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:55,270
 In other words, the matrix

36
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:56,750
 multiplication for this vector

37
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,750
 X is reduced to a scalar

38
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,549
 multiplication at this

39
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,029
 point.

40
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,790
 It's a good idea to rewrite

41
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:03,819
 this equation.

42
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,790
 For example, we can just

43
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,360
 bring lambda X to the left

44
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,989
 hand side by using the

45
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,099
 identity matrix.

46
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:12,050
 Now we have a new matrix

47
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:13,669
 that sends this vector X

48
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,910
 to the zero vector.

49
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,889
 However, this then means

50
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,669
 that the kernel of this matrix

51
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,370
 contains more than just a

52
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:21,209
 zero vector.

53
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:23,379
 Please recall in the kernel

54
00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:24,900
 we find all the vectors that

55
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,050
 are sent to zero.

56
00:01:26,449 --> 00:01:27,919
 Of course, we can also see

57
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,440
 this matrix as a map.

58
00:01:29,449 --> 00:01:31,069
 So a map that sends a vector

59
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,050
 X to the vector A

60
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,099
 minus lambda

61
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:35,309
 IX.

62
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,410
 Now having the kernel be

63
00:01:37,419 --> 00:01:38,930
 bigger than the zero space

64
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,690
 is equivalent to say that

65
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:41,970
 this map is not

66
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,709
 injective.

67
00:01:43,339 --> 00:01:43,730
 OK.

68
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:44,839
 This might be a good time

69
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:46,500
 to refresh your linear algebra

70
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,910
 knowledge and talk about

71
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:49,529
 the rank nullity theorem.

72
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,290
 It holds for all matrices

73
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,879
 M where the important thing

74
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:54,120
 is that we have the number

75
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:55,410
 N for the columns.

76
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:57,370
 This number N is the

77
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:58,809
 dimension we have as an

78
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,559
 input for this map here.

79
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,680
 And in the following sense,

80
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,930
 this dimension is

81
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,830
 conserved.

82
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:06,709
 The new dimension we get

83
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,110
 out on the right hand side

84
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,500
 is given by the dimension

85
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:10,669
 of the range of M.

86
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,710
 Therefore, this number can't

87
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,750
 be bigger than N.

88
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,539
 And in the case, it is less

89
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,910
 everything else has to go

90
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,190
 into the kernel of M.

91
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,429
 In other words, both dimensions

92
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,190
 have to add up to the original

93
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,470
 dimension we put in.

94
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,440
 Now because this formula

95
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:27,000
 connects the range and the

96
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:28,699
 kernel, we immediately get

97
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,179
 for square matrices.

98
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,660
 And this map that

99
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:32,910
 injectivity

100
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:34,929
  bijectivity and surjectivity

101
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,380
 are indeed the same thing.

102
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:38,119
 Hence, here, we could also

103
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,699
 say this map is not

104
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,410
 surjective or simply the

105
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:43,009
 map is not invertible.

106
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,119
 However, if we leave the

107
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,750
 finite dimensional case,

108
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,710
 this W nullity theorem will

109
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,910
 not hold any more.

110
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,179
 For this reason, we immediately

111
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,800
 get different possibilities

112
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:55,679
 for which the invert of this

113
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,899
 map can fail.

114
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,449
 Now, for the rest of the

115
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,860
 video, let X be a

116
00:02:59,869 --> 00:03:01,419
 complex Banach space

117
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,919
 and T from X to X

118
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:05,570
 should be a bounded linear

119
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,339
 operator.

120
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,440
 To put it.

121
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:08,740
 In other words, X is the

122
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,550
 generalization of CN

123
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:12,500
 and T for the matrix A.

124
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:14,419
 Therefore, the spectrum of

125
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:16,289
 T should be the generalization

126
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,610
 of the set of all

127
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:18,529
 eigenvalues.

128
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,669
 So it should be a subset

129
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:22,389
 of the complex numbers.

130
00:03:22,929 --> 00:03:24,589
 And usually it's denoted

131
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,250
 by the lower case Sigma.

132
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:28,850
 Now inside this set Sigma

133
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,330
 T we have all the

134
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:31,970
 complex numbers lambda

135
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,690
 such that T minus

136
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:35,529
 Lambda identity is

137
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:36,630
 not bijective.

138
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:38,440
 Therefore, if we consider

139
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:39,820
 a finite dimensional vector

140
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,539
 space X, we are in this

141
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,160
 case again and get out a

142
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:44,389
 set of all the E

143
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,199
 values.

144
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,080
 However, for the infinite

145
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,240
 dimensional case, we will

146
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,729
 see that we can split up

147
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,630
 this set into three parts.

148
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:53,199
 Before we do that, let's

149
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,770
 also define the so-called

150
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:56,389
 resolvent set of T.

151
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:58,720
 And this one is denoted by

152
00:03:58,729 --> 00:03:59,789
 a lower case W

153
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,389
 the set looks very similar.

154
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,850
 But now we look at all the

155
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,789
 complex numbers lambda where

156
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,729
 this map is indeed bijective

157
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:09,600
 and the inverse is bounded.

158
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,740
 So in some sense, these are

159
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,550
 the good points because there

160
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:15,130
 we can invert our bounded

161
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:15,850
 operator.

162
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:17,529
 Of course, at this point,

163
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,829
 you know a lot of functional

164
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,608
 analysis.

165
00:04:19,619 --> 00:04:21,220
 And therefore, you see we

166
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,029
 are working in a Banach space

167
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,399
 and therefore we can use

168
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,209
 the bounded inverse theorem,

169
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,279
 which simply means when we

170
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,089
 have the bijectivity this

171
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,250
 immediately follows.

172
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,929
 So we can just say

173
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,829
 Sigma is the complement

174
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,440
 set of

175
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,440
 rho. With this, you see

176
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,959
 why we need to work in Banach

177
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,579
 spaces because only

178
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:41,890
 there we get out the

179
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:43,399
 inverses as bounded

180
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,179
 operators and we

181
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,420
 work with complex vector

182
00:04:46,429 --> 00:04:48,140
 spaces because as we will

183
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:49,459
 later see, this spectrum

184
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,070
 gives us more information

185
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,839
 in this case.

186
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,809
 However, of course, all the

187
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,480
 definitions here also work

188
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:57,070
 with real vector spaces.

189
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,970
 When you substitute C with

190
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,600
 R. Knowing all

191
00:05:00,609 --> 00:05:02,149
 this, I can show you now

192
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,899
 how we can split up the set

193
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,750
 sigma T.

194
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,260
 The first one is the so-called

195
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:08,720
 point spectrum of T.

196
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,970
 Indeed, this is the only

197
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,269
 set we have for the finite

198
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,359
 dimensional case.

199
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,260
 However, in the infinite

200
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:16,660
 dimensional case, we also

201
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,820
 have a set, we call the

202
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:19,640
 continuous spectrum and a

203
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:21,089
 set we call the residual

204
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,750
 spectrum.

205
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,390
 Now, from the discussion

206
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,589
 above, you might already

207
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,250
 guess that we can split up

208
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,059
 the bijectivity here into

209
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,510
 injectivity and

210
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:30,420
 surjectivity.

211
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:32,350
 In fact, that's what we can

212
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:32,790
 do.

213
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,890
 And in the case that this

214
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:35,630
 operator is not injective,

215
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,309
 we define the point spectrum

216
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,820
 of T.

217
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,739
 Please recall we learned

218
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,279
 above that not injective

219
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,730
 means this operator has a

220
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:44,640
 nontrivial kernel which

221
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:46,440
 means we have eigenvectors

222
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,649
 in the sense, these points

223
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,130
 are indeed the classical

224
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,109
 eigenvalues.

225
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:51,970
 OK.

226
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,209
 Now, you should see to get

227
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,769
 a disjoint union, we also

228
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:56,029
 have to include the injectivity

229
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,070
 here.

230
00:05:57,619 --> 00:05:58,820
 So in this sense, we could

231
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:00,450
 actually do it, but it turns

232
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,089
 out we can distinguish the

233
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,290
 points even more.

234
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,609
 Now, not surjective, simply

235
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:07,049
 means that the range of the

236
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:08,910
 operator is not the whole

237
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,989
 space X.

238
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:11,940
 However, it would be a nice

239
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,709
 property to have almost a

240
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,679
 space X.

241
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:16,519
 And this would mean that

242
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:18,220
 the closure of this set is

243
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,739
 X.

244
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,559
 Now these points lambda form

245
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,149
 the continuous spectrum by

246
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,100
 definition, both names

247
00:06:25,109 --> 00:06:26,630
 are chosen in this way because

248
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,170
 for important examples, the

249
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,750
 point spectrum consists of

250
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,489
 individual points in C

251
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,029
 and the continuous spectrum

252
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,609
 forms whole intervals.

253
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,579
 This also explains the last

254
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:37,070
 name.

255
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,480
 The residual spectrum just

256
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:39,750
 gets all other points

257
00:06:40,549 --> 00:06:40,929
 here.

258
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,290
 The operator is injective

259
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:43,429
 but not surjective.

260
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,010
 And even the closure of the

261
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:46,670
 range is not X.

262
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:48,290
 Here, I can tell you for

263
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:49,880
 the property that the closure

264
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,200
 is the whole set X.

265
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:52,959
 We simply say the range

266
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,450
 lies dense in X.

267
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,089
 Later, you will see that

268
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,350
 for many important

269
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:58,970
 examples, the last set is

270
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,929
 indeed empty.

271
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:01,959
 This is not always the case,

272
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,480
 but for these examples, we

273
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,989
 only have to deal with these

274
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,829
 two sets here.

275
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:06,959
 OK.

276
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,500
 Then let's use the next video

277
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,160
 to look at some examples.

278
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:11,989
 Therefore, I hope I see you

279
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,480
 there and have a nice day.

280
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:14,239
 Bye.
