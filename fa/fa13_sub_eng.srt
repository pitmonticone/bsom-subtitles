00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,190
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,400
 functional analysis.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,070
 And as always, many thanks

4
00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:06,480
 to all the nice people that

5
00:00:06,489 --> 00:00:08,148
 support this channel on Steady

6
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:08,949
 or paypal.

7
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,210
 Today in part 13, we

8
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,670
 talk about operators

9
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,550
 between non spaces.

10
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:16,309
 So the picture should look

11
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:16,930
 like this.

12
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,469
 We have one norm space on

13
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:19,879
 the left hand side and one

14
00:00:19,889 --> 00:00:20,899
 on the right hand side.

15
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:23,250
 Now an operator T is just

16
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,010
 a map that conserves some

17
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,450
 structures of our spaces.

18
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,190
 We don't call T a function

19
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,700
 but an operator simply

20
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:32,549
 because often we have a

21
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,330
 space of functions as a domain

22
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,290
 or the co domain.

23
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,479
 So every time you see the

24
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,229
 notion operator, you know,

25
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,770
 it's just another name for

26
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:41,639
 a special map.

27
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,939
 Now the first property that

28
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,560
 T should conserve is the

29
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:47,130
 algebraic structure, the

30
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:48,790
 linear structure given in

31
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:49,639
 the vector space.

32
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:52,090
 In other words, the map should

33
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:53,330
 be a linear map.

34
00:00:54,169 --> 00:00:54,470
 OK.

35
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:56,119
 There we have one half of

36
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,490
 our functional analytical

37
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,220
 world and the other half

38
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:00,549
 should be the topological

39
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,069
 structure.

40
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:02,970
 This is what we already know

41
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,638
 because in a metric space,

42
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,169
 we have a notion of open

43
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,650
 sets.

44
00:01:07,339 --> 00:01:09,089
 And the property that conserves

45
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:10,830
 these open sets is what we

46
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:12,080
 learned in the last video

47
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:13,959
 and is called continuity.

48
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,120
 Of course, this seems a little

49
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:16,940
 bit abstract.

50
00:01:16,949 --> 00:01:18,300
 But we will now see that

51
00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:20,150
 for non spaces as we have

52
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,739
 it here, we can define

53
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,459
 another property we call

54
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,099
 bounded.

55
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:26,510
 And we will see that together

56
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,870
 with the linearity, this

57
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,489
 is indeed equivalent to the

58
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,389
 continuity in the

59
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,029
 sense one often speaks of

60
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,870
 linear bounded operators

61
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,709
 between two norm spaces.

62
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,099
 OK.

63
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,260
 Then let's start with the

64
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:40,660
 definition of the notion

65
00:01:40,669 --> 00:01:42,610
 bounded as before we

66
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,339
 have two norm spaces and

67
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:45,519
 a linear map T

68
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:47,779
 of course, linear always

69
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,349
 means it conserves the vector

70
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,669
 addition and the scalar

71
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,559
 multiplication.

72
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:53,330
 This means that we have these

73
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:54,169
 two formulas.

74
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,580
 And maybe you also recognize

75
00:01:55,589 --> 00:01:57,180
 another common notation here

76
00:01:57,529 --> 00:01:58,870
 for linear maps, we will

77
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,500
 omit parentheses if

78
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,139
 possible.

79
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,180
 Now what we want is the

80
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,080
 length of this linear map.

81
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:06,639
 So we want a norm for the

82
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,300
 operator.

83
00:02:07,949 --> 00:02:09,300
 Hence this is then often

84
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:10,960
 called just the operator

85
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,740
 norm of T.

86
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,809
 And if we want to emphasize

87
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,169
 the spaces, the map acts

88
00:02:15,179 --> 00:02:17,089
 on, we have to put them in

89
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,850
 the index.

90
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,490
 However, most of the time

91
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,240
 we will omit them there because

92
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,800
 the corresponding normed spaces

93
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,250
 are known from the beginning.

94
00:02:24,899 --> 00:02:25,330
 OK.

95
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:26,490
 But we still don't know how

96
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,520
 to measure this length.

97
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,240
 So let's start with an idea.

98
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,130
 Now, imagine we have our

99
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:32,429
 norm space X on the left

100
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,380
 hand side and Y on the right

101
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:36,139
 hand side, let's pick a

102
00:02:36,149 --> 00:02:36,940
 vector X.

103
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,330
 And we know we can measure

104
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:39,509
 the length of X.

105
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:41,880
 And now we know the map T

106
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:43,570
 acting on this vector will

107
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,639
 give us a new vector.

108
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:45,190
 And why?

109
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,130
 So here we have the vector

110
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,850
 TX with length

111
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,160
 norm of TX.

112
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,929
 Of course, here we have to

113
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,139
 measure the length with the

114
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:54,070
 Norman Y.

115
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,449
 And here we have to measure

116
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,649
 it with the Norman X.

117
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,850
 What we now can put in relation

118
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,610
 is how much did the length

119
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:02,369
 change from left to right?

120
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:04,520
 In other words, what is the

121
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:06,199
 quotient of the length of

122
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,960
 TX divided by the

123
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,070
 length of X?

124
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:11,399
 Of course, this is now a

125
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,139
 number we could use as a

126
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:15,070
 definition for the norm

127
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,649
 of T.

128
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:17,509
 However, of course, this

129
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,089
 can only be meaningful if

130
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,009
 we look at all possible inputs

131
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,110
 on the left hand side.

132
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,339
 So we're looking at all possible

133
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,089
 ratios that can come out

134
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,509
 by going through all the

135
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:27,699
 xs.

136
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,729
 Obviously, the only exception

137
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,050
 should be the zero vector

138
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,639
 because this one is the only

139
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:33,929
 one with lengths of zero.

140
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:35,970
 Now, you might already see

141
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:37,529
 that the norm of T should

142
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:39,169
 be the biggest ratio we can

143
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:39,970
 get out here.

144
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,800
 So the maximum of the set,

145
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:44,520
 however, we can have an infinite

146
00:03:44,529 --> 00:03:45,649
 dimension in X.

147
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,309
 So we have infinitely many

148
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,820
 directions we can look at.

149
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:50,570
 Therefore, it can happen

150
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,149
 that the maximum does not

151
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,990
 exist.

152
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,740
 So what we need here is the

153
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,059
 supreme of this set.

154
00:03:56,899 --> 00:03:58,330
 We are in the real numbers.

155
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,070
 So we know the supreme always

156
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,470
 exists in the worst case

157
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,229
 it would be the symbol infinity.

158
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:05,110
 And there we have our notion

159
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,860
 if this norm of T is

160
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:08,619
 finite, we call T

161
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,330
 bounded.

162
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,759
 And I already mentioned that

163
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,679
 non bounded linear operators

164
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,559
 can only happen if X is

165
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,720
 of infinite dimension.

166
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,019
 And please note that this

167
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,950
 notion of bounded for linear

168
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,850
 operators is different than

169
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:24,829
 the notion bounded for normal

170
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,549
 functions in R for example.

171
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:28,799
 So please don't get confused

172
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:29,200
 there.

173
00:04:29,989 --> 00:04:31,049
 Now, with the definition,

174
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:32,380
 out of the way, let's go

175
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,940
 to the proposition that connects

176
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,630
 this to the continuity.

177
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:36,600
 Here.

178
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,989
 Again, we have a linear map

179
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,809
 between two norm spaces.

180
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,929
 So the same thing as before

181
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,540
 and then we know the following

182
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,290
 three things are equivalent.

183
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:47,799
 The first is that T as a

184
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,380
 map between metric spaces

185
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,579
 is continuous.

186
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,309
 Now B is similar but

187
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,630
 here T has only to be

188
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,559
 continuous at one point

189
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,890
 when we choose the origin

190
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:58,690
 at this point.

191
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:00,899
 And the last one is that

192
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,570
 T as a linear operator

193
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:04,130
 between norm spaces

194
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:05,799
 is a bounded operator.

195
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,279
 So this is the fact I already

196
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,279
 told you at the beginning

197
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,799
 continuity and

198
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:12,750
 bounded this exactly in this

199
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,730
 sense are equivalent terms

200
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:16,279
 for linear operators.

201
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,540
 And of course, this is so

202
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:19,809
 important that we should

203
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,970
 write down a proof.

204
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,339
 The first implication we

205
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,010
 should show is A to

206
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:26,950
 B which is obviously

207
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,649
 immediately fulfilled because

208
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,230
 being continuous at all

209
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,760
 points implies being

210
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,350
 continuous at zero.

211
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,410
 So let's go to the next one

212
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,859
 which would be the implication

213
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,380
 from B to C.

214
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,480
 Here we really have to do

215
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:41,190
 something.

216
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,540
 So let's start by writing

217
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:43,859
 down what it means to be

218
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:45,339
 continuous at zero.

219
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,410
 As often we want to use the

220
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,089
 characterization with sequences.

221
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,079
 So here we consider convergence

222
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:52,660
 sequences but only with

223
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,010
 limit 0.0.

224
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,200
 The continuity then implies

225
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:57,709
 that the images also

226
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,399
 converge.

227
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,480
 And because we have a linear

228
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:01,459
 map, the limit point is also

229
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,000
 zero.

230
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:03,989
 However, here it might be

231
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,119
 easier to work with an epsilon

232
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:06,920
 delta characterization for

233
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:07,929
 the continuity.

234
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,220
 So let me write down the

235
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,369
 claim we need here.

236
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,209
 The formulation before which

237
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,119
 we call star now implies

238
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,149
 there is a delta

239
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,279
 such that the norm of

240
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,140
 TX is always less

241
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:20,890
 than one for

242
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:22,839
 all x with length less

243
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,640
 than delta.

244
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,279
 If you know continuity, you

245
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,790
 already know that you already

246
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:28,660
 believe that.

247
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:30,220
 But for the sake of completeness,

248
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,549
 let's write down the proof,

249
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,570
 let's do a proof by contra

250
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:34,079
 position.

251
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:35,790
 So let's call the whole right

252
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:36,799
 hand side here.

253
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:38,869
 Just star in wet

254
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,540
 the negation of the red star

255
00:06:41,549 --> 00:06:42,799
 then implies

256
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,779
 that for all N, we

257
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,980
 find an XN

258
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,600
 with length X and

259
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,470
 less than one over N,

260
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:53,829
 the one over N corresponds

261
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,820
 to the delta here.

262
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,399
 So we say there is no such

263
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:56,950
 delta.

264
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,660
 So we can do that for all

265
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,640
 N here, which also

266
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:02,230
 means that the norm of

267
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,809
 TXN is greater or equal than

268
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,230
 one.

269
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,519
 And there you see we found

270
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:08,950
 a sequence that converges

271
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,630
 to zero.

272
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,470
 But the images don't converge

273
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,109
 to zero.

274
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,220
 So this applies then

275
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,790
 not green star.

276
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,760
 And by contraposition,

277
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:19,320
 this proves the claim we

278
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:20,000
 want to use.

279
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,440
 Now

280
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:23,049
 we call that we want to

281
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:24,970
 calculate the quotient of

282
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,660
 the norm of TX

283
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,329
 divided by the norm of

284
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:28,890
 X.

285
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:30,869
 However, at the moment, we

286
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,279
 can only say something about

287
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,269
 the vector X that have length

288
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,559
 less than delta.

289
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,320
 Of course, this is something

290
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:38,829
 we can use here because we

291
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,760
 could multiply with delta

292
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:42,390
 half, which is less than

293
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,119
 a delta times

294
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,809
 one over the norm of X.

295
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,730
 So why do we do that?

296
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:49,209
 Simply because with that

297
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,880
 factor, we can scale the

298
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,230
 length of the vector X

299
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,769
 since you know the properties

300
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,070
 of the norm, you know, we

301
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,549
 can push that inside the

302
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,089
 norm.

303
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,410
 And you also know that T

304
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,100
 is linear.

305
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,970
 So what we get in the

306
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,829
 denominator is a vector

307
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,410
 that has exactly length

308
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,450
 delta half.

309
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:07,059
 And that's something that

310
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,019
 reminds us of our red star

311
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,730
 property.

312
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,970
 The vector has length less

313
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,690
 than delta.

314
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,250
 So the corresponding image

315
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,890
 has length less than one.

316
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:18,350
 Hence, the numerator is now

317
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:20,049
 less than one, which means

318
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:21,640
 the whole thing is less than

319
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:22,829
 two over delta.

320
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,140
 So the only thing that remains

321
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:26,980
 is applying the supreme

322
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:28,820
 on both sides now,

323
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:29,929
 since we exclude the zero

324
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,179
 vector, we know this all

325
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,058
 works also the supreme

326
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,929
 has to be less than two over

327
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,419
 delta.

328
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:36,929
 The important thing is of

329
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,200
 course, this is not

330
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:38,940
 infinity.

331
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,429
 Well, this was B to C

332
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,169
 continuity at zero

333
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,578
 implies bounded.

334
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,119
 And now the last part is

335
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,570
 a bounded operator is

336
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,010
 continuous everywhere.

337
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,469
 So let's consider any point

338
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,469
 X tilde in X and any

339
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:56,239
 sequence that is convergent

340
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,159
 to this point.

341
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,799
 And then we want to look

342
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:00,219
 what happens to the images.

343
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:01,320
 So we look at

344
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,409
 TXN

345
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:04,260
 minus TX tilde

346
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,099
 inside the norm of Y.

347
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:08,330
 Then the linearity tells

348
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,080
 us that we can apply T to

349
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,700
 the difference vector and

350
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,039
 then calculate the nom.

351
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,299
 And now we can use what we

352
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:16,840
 know we have to find an

353
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,280
 operator norm of T

354
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,239
 which is by definition the

355
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,039
 largest possible scaling

356
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:23,400
 for the length of the image.

357
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,210
 In other words, we know this

358
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:26,760
 is less or equal than the

359
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,520
 operator norm times the

360
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,679
 length of the input.

361
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,809
 And that's XN minus

362
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:32,599
 X tilde.

363
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,719
 Since we already know this

364
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:36,090
 is convergent, we know this

365
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:37,979
 goes to zero when N goes

366
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:38,969
 to infinity.

367
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,320
 So the whole right hand side

368
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,270
 goes to zero.

369
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,469
 Hence also the left hand

370
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:45,150
 side which tells us that

371
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,789
 also the images converge

372
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,679
 and that's by definition,

373
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,679
 the continuity.

374
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,359
 So our proof is finished.

375
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:52,390
 OK.

376
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,349
 So this was our first important

377
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:55,830
 result for linear

378
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,340
 operators between norm

379
00:09:57,349 --> 00:09:57,989
 spaces.

380
00:09:58,729 --> 00:10:00,099
 What you can do for yourself

381
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:01,489
 now is showing that this

382
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,309
 operator norm be defined

383
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,969
 is indeed a norm in the

384
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,809
 usual sense with

385
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,119
 that.

386
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,109
 I think it's good enough

387
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:08,750
 for today.

388
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,109
 Thanks for listening.

389
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,500
 Thanks for supporting me

390
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,989
 and see you next time.

391
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,710
 Bye.
