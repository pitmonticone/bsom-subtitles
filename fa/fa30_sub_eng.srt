00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:02,220
Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,890
functional analysis.

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:05,909
And there's always many,

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,349
many thanks to all the nice

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,449
people that support this

6
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,340
channel on study or paypal.

7
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,699
In today's part 30 we are

8
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,560
still talking about spectral

9
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:15,260
theory.

10
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:17,100
This means that we still

11
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,940
analyze the set sigma of

12
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,739
T which is the spectrum

13
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,159
of the operator T.

14
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,719
So we have all complex numbers

15
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:26,420
lambda such that T

16
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,209
minus lambda identity

17
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:29,680
is not invertible.

18
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:31,750
On the other hand, we have

19
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,349
the complement the resolvent

20
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,200
set of T which is denoted

21
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:36,029
by a row.

22
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,299
Now please remember in this

23
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,220
context, we will always omit

24
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:42,110
mentioning the identity operator

25
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:42,450
here.

26
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,810
It's simply shorter in this

27
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:45,159
way.

28
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,830
Also don't forget we do

29
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,790
everything in a complex Banach

30
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:50,779
space X

31
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:53,459
and for a bounded linear

32
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,159
operator T from

33
00:00:55,169 --> 00:00:56,180
X to X.

34
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,330
OK.

35
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,090
Now, in this context, we

36
00:00:59,099 --> 00:01:01,009
have some nice results about

37
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,729
the spectrum.

38
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,230
So let's summarize some facts

39
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,620
in one proposition.

40
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,160
First, I can tell you that

41
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:09,569
the resolvent set is

42
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,290
always an open set.

43
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,480
In conclusion, this means

44
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:15,370
that the spectrum is always

45
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:16,239
a close set.

46
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:18,629
Therefore, the visualization

47
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:20,069
should always be that you

48
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,559
are in the complex plane

49
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:23,639
and you have some close set,

50
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,900
which is the spectrum of

51
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,620
T and everything

52
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:28,379
outside is an open set,

53
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:30,050
which is the resolvent set.

54
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:32,769
Later, we will also see that

55
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:34,309
the spectrum of a bounded

56
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:36,300
linear operator is also

57
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:38,239
a bounded set or in

58
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,800
other words, this spectrum

59
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:40,800
is compact.

60
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:41,980
OK.

61
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:43,919
Now, for part B let's take

62
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,529
an element from the resolvent

63
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:45,949
set.

64
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,209
So here we just have a complex

65
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,480
number lambda.

66
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,639
Now, the good thing we know

67
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,569
is that the operator T minus

68
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,519
lambda has an inverse.

69
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,690
So writing the power minus

70
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:59,220
one here makes sense.

71
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:00,849
And we can also calculate

72
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,959
the operator norm

73
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:04,610
which is always greater

74
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,589
or equal than

75
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,070
one divided by the

76
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,910
distance of Lambda to the

77
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,910
spectrum in the picture.

78
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,759
This means what is the shortest

79
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,710
distance we have to go until

80
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,580
we reach a point in the spectrum.

81
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,559
And this is simply what we

82
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,910
call the distance from a

83
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,279
point to a set.

84
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:24,490
So you see the closer

85
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,800
lambda is to the spectrum

86
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:27,679
of T, the bigger this

87
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,699
norm has to be

88
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:29,740
OK.

89
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,550
Here we observe that we can

90
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:33,320
have different operators

91
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,889
when we have different, values

92
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:35,779
lambda.

93
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,199
Hence, we can look at a map

94
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,000
that sends lambda to this

95
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:40,740
operator.

96
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,710
Of course, lambda has to

97
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,320
come from the resolvent set.

98
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,199
But then we get a bounded

99
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,580
operator on X.

100
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,110
So here BX denotes

101
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:51,770
the space of all bounded

102
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:53,720
linear operators from X

103
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:54,559
into X.

104
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,250
And now our result

105
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:59,160
is that this map is

106
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:00,509
an analytical map

107
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,990
in short, this nice map is

108
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,619
often called the resolvent.

109
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,009
Of course, at this point,

110
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,410
you should ask yourself,

111
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,050
what does it mean for a map

112
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:11,339
like this to be

113
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,250
analytical?

114
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:14,289
The short explanation here

115
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,970
would be just the definition

116
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,570
which tells us this map

117
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,929
locally can be

118
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,429
expressed as a Taylor

119
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,089
series.

120
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:24,339
What this means exactly.

121
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,850
I will show you in the proof

122
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,820
of this statement.

123
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:28,880
Therefore, let's immediately

124
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,440
start proving these

125
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:31,000
things.

126
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,179
First, you should note in

127
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,500
the case that the resolvent

128
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:35,669
set is empty.

129
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,649
Everything here is trivially

130
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,149
true.

131
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:40,399
For this reason, let's consider

132
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,610
the case where we have at

133
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:43,399
least one point lambda

134
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,350
zero in the resolvent set.

135
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,589
This means that the operator

136
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,960
T minus lambda

137
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,800
zero has an inverse.

138
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:52,759
Then for the next part, let's

139
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,470
consider the operator norm

140
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,750
of this operator,

141
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,589
it's a constant.

142
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,990
I want to call C

143
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,559
and the reciprocal I want

144
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,860
to call epsilon.

145
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:03,960
OK.

146
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,289
Now, what we want to do I

147
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,669
can visualize in the picture

148
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,220
above.

149
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:09,110
So here we have lambda zero

150
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,350
and now I want to look at

151
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,059
the epsilon ball around this

152
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,880
point in the complex plane.

153
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,000
Now, when we show that this

154
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,660
epsilon ball is completely

155
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,170
inside the resolvent set,

156
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:21,820
we have shown that the resolvent

157
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,730
set is indeed an open set.

158
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,790
Therefore, let's take an

159
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,519
arbitrary element from this

160
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:28,450
epsilon ball.

161
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,329
So it's a complex number

162
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:32,049
lambda where the distance

163
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:33,950
to lambda zero is less

164
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,959
than epsilon.

165
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,130
OK.

166
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,880
Now, having this, our plan

167
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,190
is to show that this

168
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,049
operator T minus lambda

169
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:42,730
is also invertible.

170
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:45,269
Therefore, let's calculate

171
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:45,829
a little bit.

172
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,149
Now we want to transform

173
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,510
this to the operator we already

174
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:49,829
know.

175
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,750
So T minus lambda zero.

176
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:53,450
Therefore, we have to add

177
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,880
and subtract lambda zero

178
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,750
here or for example,

179
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,440
we can write the equality

180
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,390
in this way.

181
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,380
Then in the next step, the

182
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,799
operator we already know

183
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:03,880
is invertible.

184
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,619
We can just factor out here.

185
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,679
So here we have the identity

186
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,109
operator minus

187
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,899
lambda minus lambda zero

188
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,540
times the inverse.

189
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:14,579
OK.

190
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:16,380
Now I can tell you why this

191
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,269
form here is so helpful for

192
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:18,609
us.

193
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,720
For this reason, let's call

194
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,140
this operator here.

195
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:23,089
Just s

196
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,049
first, let's look at

197
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,769
the operator norm of S

198
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,859
where we can just use that

199
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:30,299
this one is less than

200
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:32,279
epsilon and this one is in

201
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,779
the operator norm C.

202
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,010
So in summary, this whole

203
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:37,739
thing is less than epsilon

204
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,720
times C which is by

205
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,140
the definition of epsilon

206
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:42,279
just one.

207
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,480
So here you should see we

208
00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:46,190
have an operator with operator

209
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,000
norm exactly one where we

210
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,739
subtract an operator with

211
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,010
norm less than one.

212
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,200
And the result is such a

213
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:55,000
combination is always

214
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:55,910
invertible.

215
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,220
Indeed, this is called a

216
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,579
Neumann series

217
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,309
an operator I minus S

218
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,299
where the norm of S is less

219
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:05,579
than one is

220
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:06,459
invertible.

221
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:08,559
Because the reasoning goes

222
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,239
like for the geometric series

223
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,019
for numbers, this

224
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:13,529
means that we multiply the

225
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,380
operator I minus S

226
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,070
with the sum of the powers

227
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:17,660
of S.

228
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:19,750
And then it does not matter

229
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,010
if we multiply it from the

230
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:22,290
right or the left,

231
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:24,410
we just get the same result

232
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,890
by telescoping the two

233
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:27,829
sums, which means

234
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,410
I minus S to the

235
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,950
power N plus one.

236
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,910
And now we can use that the

237
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,549
operator norm of S is less

238
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:36,410
than one, which means that

239
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,809
this sequence here

240
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,510
converges to zero

241
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,359
when N goes to infinity.

242
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,619
And of course, this convergence

243
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,079
is measured with the operator

244
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:45,589
norm.

245
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,720
Therefore, we conclude if

246
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,450
we have an infinite sum here.

247
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,640
So a series,

248
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,149
then this operator defines

249
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,059
the inverse of I minus

250
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,010
S indeed this

251
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:58,790
series is well defined as

252
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,730
a limit because the norm

253
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:02,179
of S is less than one.

254
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,890
And we call it the Neumann

255
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:04,579
series.

256
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:05,450
OK.

257
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,079
Now, this nice general

258
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:08,920
result we can use here

259
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,339
because now we can conclude

260
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,059
that T minus Lambda

261
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,940
is also invertible.

262
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:16,679
That's simply because it's

263
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,540
the product of two invertible

264
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:19,339
operators.

265
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:21,799
And this is true for all

266
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,440
Lambda with this proper T

267
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,200
and also lambda zero

268
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:26,839
was arbitrary chosen,

269
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,640
therefore row of T

270
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:29,500
is open.

271
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:32,059
In conclusion, our spectrum

272
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,970
sigma of T is closed.

273
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:35,529
So the whole statement in

274
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,790
A is proven

275
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,220
also, you might already see

276
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,640
that we have in equation

277
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:42,619
above our Taylor series.

278
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:44,570
More concretely, we have

279
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:46,519
T minus Lambda is equal

280
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:48,290
to T minus lambda zero

281
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:49,890
times the Neumann series.

282
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,260
Or to put it.

283
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:52,489
In correct words, we get

284
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,000
the Neumann series when we

285
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,720
look at the inverses here.

286
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:57,730
And don't forget taking

287
00:07:57,739 --> 00:07:59,359
inverses changes the order

288
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:00,390
of the operators.

289
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,500
Therefore, we have the Neumann

290
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,799
series in front.

291
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:05,000
OK.

292
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,410
At this point, we can just

293
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,970
substitute our operator S

294
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,679
again.

295
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:10,709
And then we get the

296
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,970
series where we have this

297
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,640
product to the power K.

298
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,459
So what you should see is

299
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,079
lambda minus lambda zero

300
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:18,880
to the power K which looks

301
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,200
like a Taylor series.

302
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:20,980
OK.

303
00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:22,399
Maybe when we combine these

304
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,839
two operators and put them

305
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,760
in formed, then you see this

306
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:27,519
is exactly a Taylor series.

307
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,709
So these are just constant

308
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,369
coefficients but now they

309
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,359
are operators but

310
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:34,349
otherwise it looks like a

311
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:36,340
totally common Taylor series.

312
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,280
And there you see this is

313
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,770
exactly what we call an

314
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,940
analytical map.

315
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,659
And therefore C is also

316
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:43,280
finished.

317
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:44,159
OK.

318
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:45,669
Having this, let's close

319
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,520
the video by proving B.

320
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,109
So if we now take a complex

321
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:51,900
number lambda from the spectrum

322
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:53,859
of T, then we know from

323
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:55,349
above that there's no other

324
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:56,260
choice than that.

325
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,869
The distance from LAMBDA

326
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,859
to LAMBDA zero is

327
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:01,349
greater or equal than

328
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:02,140
epsilon.

329
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,830
And then looking at the reciprocals,

330
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,659
we get that one

331
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:08,309
over the distance is less

332
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,539
or equal than C.

333
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,409
And they are, please recall

334
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:12,770
this is simply the operator

335
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,630
norm of T minus lambda

336
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,020
zero inverse.

337
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:18,059
And with this, we are almost

338
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,510
finished.

339
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,200
Now we just have to go through

340
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,960
all the points in the spectrum.

341
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:22,830
OK.

342
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,020
Maybe let's write it down

343
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,229
with more details.

344
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:27,049
So the distance here is just

345
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:28,789
the infimum where we

346
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,020
simply go through all the

347
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,429
points lambda in the

348
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,109
spectrum.

349
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,349
And now if we pull the infimum

350
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,309
out of the denominator, it

351
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,359
gets a supremum.

352
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,320
And at this point, we can

353
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,989
just use the inequality from

354
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,539
above.

355
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:43,020
And then we have shown our

356
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,840
claim or in other

357
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:46,479
words, also be is

358
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:48,049
shown OK.

359
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:49,289
With this, I hope I see you

360
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:50,440
in the next video where I

361
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,250
show you how we can use all

362
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:52,690
of this.

363
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:54,799
Have a nice day and see you

364
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:55,239
then.

365
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:55,950
Bye.
