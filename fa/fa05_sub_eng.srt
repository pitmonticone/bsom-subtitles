00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,400
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,650
 functional analysis.

3
00:00:03,769 --> 00:00:04,960
 And as always, I want to

4
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:06,400
 thank all the nice people

5
00:00:06,409 --> 00:00:07,469
 that support the channel

6
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,789
 on Steady or PayPal.

7
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:11,159
 Today's part five is about

8
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,020
 Cauchy sequences and complete

9
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:14,000
 metric spaces.

10
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:16,318
 And as promised in the last

11
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,209
 video, we start here with

12
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,159
 an example.

13
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,229
 Our metric space has as a

14
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:23,159
 set the interval from 0

15
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,780
 to 3 with the normal

16
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,319
 metric for the real numbers.

17
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:28,350
 Hence this is something you

18
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,190
 already know.

19
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,000
 What you also know is that

20
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,919
 the subset 0 to 3, which

21
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,360
 is the whole space, is a

22
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,240
 closed set inside

23
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,279
 this metric space.

24
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,630
 For example, you could argue

25
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:41,880
 that the complement which

26
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:43,369
 is the empty set is clearly

27
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:43,830
 open.

28
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,229
 Or you can use the fact from

29
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,630
 the last video where you

30
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:49,150
 consider any convergence

31
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:51,150
 sequence with members from

32
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,930
 the subset. Being a

33
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:54,430
 convergent sequence means

34
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,099
 it has a limit which we call

35
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,750
 x tilde

36
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,900
 and of course, it has to

37
00:00:57,909 --> 00:00:58,650
 lie in X.

38
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,599
 What we proved last time

39
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,069
 was now; the set is closed,

40
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,849
 if the limit is also in the

41
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,800
 subset. Of course here you

42
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:06,970
 see immediately that this

43
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,720
 is true, because the subset

44
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,489
 (0,3) is the whole space

45
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:10,970
 X.

46
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:13,050
 Now a question that often

47
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:14,750
 arises with such an example

48
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,629
 is the following.

49
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,129
 what is about the sequence

50
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:19,319
 1 over N?

51
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:21,529
 Clearly this is a sequence

52
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,169
 in X. First member is

53
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,660
 1, next one is 1/2

54
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:25,919
 and so on.

55
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,199
 You see all the members are

56
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:29,190
 positive, so they lie in

57
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:31,160
 this interval and the

58
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:32,599
 distance between two members

59
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,519
 of the sequence.

60
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:34,779
 So maybe let's call them

61
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,160
 x_n, x_m.

62
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,959
 This number gets

63
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,730
 smaller and smaller when

64
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:41,599
 x and m get larger and

65
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,120
 larger.

66
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:44,150
 So we could write it in this

67
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,550
 way,

68
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,650
 but the important thing is

69
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,029
 that you see that you get

70
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,959
 closer and closer to something

71
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,019
 with the sequence.

72
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:52,360
 However, still, it does

73
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,430
 not converge.

74
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,440
 For our example, this is

75
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,059
 easy to see, because the

76
00:01:57,069 --> 00:01:58,760
 only possible limit this

77
00:01:58,769 --> 00:01:59,699
 sequence could have in the

78
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:01,099
 real numbers would be the

79
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:01,959
 number zero.

80
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,260
 However, zero is not in

81
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:05,889
 X, there is no number

82
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,389
 zero in our universe

83
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:07,699
 here.

84
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,309
 In summary, we found a metric

85
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,770
 space which owns a

86
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:13,259
 sequence, which should

87
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,869
 converge but there is no

88
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,539
 point in the space, where

89
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,660
 the sequence leads to.

90
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,839
 Therefore, one could say

91
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,470
 there is a hole in the space,

92
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,080
 but we will say the space

93
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:24,149
 is not complete.

94
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,500
 So now we have to give a

95
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:28,050
 formal definition for a

96
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:29,550
 complete metric space.

97
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,220
 First, for given metric space

98
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:34,179
 (X, d) sequences

99
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,729
 that fulfill this property

100
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,389
 here are called cauchy

101
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:38,160
 sequences.

102
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,949
 More concretely

103
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,630
 this means for all

104
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,440
 epsilon greater than zero,

105
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,990
 there exists an index capital

106
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,979
 N in N, such

107
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,669
 that for all indices

108
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,839
 n, m greater than

109
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,410
 this index N, we

110
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:55,020
 have that the

111
00:02:55,029 --> 00:02:56,289
 distance between the members

112
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,080
 x_n, x_m is arbitrarily

113
00:02:58,089 --> 00:02:59,940
 small, so less than epsilon.

114
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:02,240
 So this is the actual meaning

115
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,479
 of this limit before.

116
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,210
 What you should be able to

117
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,869
 show now is if you have a

118
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,509
 convergent sequence, then

119
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,289
 this thing is also fulfilled.

120
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,729
 The Cauchy sequence is therefore

121
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,419
 always a generalization of

122
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:15,600
 a convergence sequence.

123
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,000
 So you see there's no limit,

124
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:19,720
 there's no x tilde in the

125
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:21,559
 definition of a Cauchy sequence.

126
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,899
 Hence, it would be much nicer

127
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,539
 working with this definition

128
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,910
 than working with the one

129
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,300
 for the convergent sequences.

130
00:03:29,029 --> 00:03:30,289
 However, we already know

131
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,089
 the problem. This does not

132
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,089
 work in general.

133
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,589
 Now the nice spaces where

134
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,220
 this actually works, we call

135
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:37,820
 complete.

136
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:40,350
 Therefore, we say here all

137
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,100
 Cauchy sequences converge.

138
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:44,250
 In other words, something

139
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:46,110
 like above can't happen then

140
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,220
 and of course, you already

141
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,910
 know how to fix the example

142
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,399
 above.

143
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:52,660
 We could change the set X

144
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:54,470
 when we include zero and

145
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,089
 three.

146
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,660
 Then of course, now the

147
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:57,899
 space is complete.

148
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:59,940
 You might already see the

149
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:01,740
 general result here, because

150
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,240
 we consider metric spaces

151
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,039
 coming from the real numbers

152
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,830
 R with the same metric as

153
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:07,259
 R.

154
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:09,639
 Therefore, as long as the

155
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,600
 set X is closed in

156
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,460
 R, which means in a

157
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,839
 metric space (R, d) in

158
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,839
 this case, then what

159
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,500
 we get out is a complete

160
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,358
 metric space.

161
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:21,678
 However, that is just because

162
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:23,049
 we already knew that

163
00:04:23,058 --> 00:04:24,928
 (R,d) is a complete metric

164
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:25,389
 space.

165
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,570
 You might already feel that

166
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:29,079
 this should work in general

167
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,170
 and you are correct.

168
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,910
 If you have a complete metric

169
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,609
 space, you can form new

170
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:35,089
 ones just by considering

171
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,019
 the closed subsets with the

172
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:37,809
 same metric.

173
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:39,589
 However, that's something

174
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,510
 we can prove later.

175
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,829
 Let's first look at another

176
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,420
 example.

177
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,559
 Now we don't change the set.

178
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,850
 We still consider the interval

179
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,410
 0 to 3 where we exclude

180
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,420
 zero and three.

181
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:50,049
 But now we change the metric

182
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:51,320
 and I want to choose the

183
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:52,399
 discrete metric.

184
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,260
 So this is what we defined

185
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:55,790
 in part two as a discrete

186
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:56,299
 metric.

187
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,000
 Now my claim is this is

188
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,619
 also a complete metric

189
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,149
 space.

190
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,059
 Indeed, that's not hard to

191
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,809
 show we just choose an arbitrary

192
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,059
 Cauchy sequence here.

193
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:08,459
 Then we know this whole thing

194
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,739
 here holds for all

195
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,720
 epsilon so that I can just

196
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,679
 take one and I want to

197
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,649
 have epsilon as one half.

198
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,630
 Then we know there is a

199
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,250
 capital N such that

200
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,679
 all indices that are

201
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,549
 created than N fulfill this

202
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:22,890
 one.

203
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:25,079
 This means that the distance

204
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:26,959
 between x_n and x_m is

205
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,739
 less than epsilon or in other

206
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,510
 words, less than one half.

207
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:33,049
 However, now we see in the

208
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:34,529
 definition of the metric

209
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,290
 that less than one half is

210
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:37,739
 only possible in the bottom

211
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,170
 case.

212
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:40,160
 Therefore, the distance is

213
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,459
 indeed zero,

214
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,260
 which again means that x_n

215
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:45,899
 is the same as x_m.

216
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,859
 So please note this works

217
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,750
 for almost all indices here.

218
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:51,769
 Only finitely many before

219
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,019
 could be different.

220
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,500
 Hence, it tells you that

221
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,500
 the sequence is indeed constant

222
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,700
 after the index N

223
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,220
 OK, maybe let's look at the

224
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,420
 graph where we have here

225
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:03,829
 the indices and here the

226
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,820
 space X. At

227
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:07,220
 the beginning the sequence

228
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,690
 is allowed to do something.

229
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,230
 However, the value it reaches

230
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,989
 with the index N is then

231
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,690
 fixed for the entire time

232
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,540
 of the sequence.

233
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:17,790
 So you could say this is

234
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,630
 quite a boring sequence because

235
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,869
 it does not change anymore.

236
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:23,040
 However, for such a sequence,

237
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,829
 it's easy to show that it

238
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,549
 is a convergence sequence

239
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,950
 with the limit x tilde

240
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,929
 as exactly this constant

241
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,390
 in the end.

242
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:32,609
 And now we have seen that

243
00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:34,209
 these are indeed the only

244
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,119
 possible convergence sequences

245
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,690
 in a discrete metric space.

246
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,279
 And of course, we have also

247
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,239
 shown that this one is indeed

248
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,690
 a complete metric space.

249
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:43,989
 OK.

250
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,859
 Maybe that's good enough

251
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:45,609
 for today.

252
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,970
 In the next video, we will

253
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,750
 look at some important complete

254
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,679
 metric spaces.

255
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:51,540
 So I hope I see you there

256
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:52,540
 and goodbye.
