Hello and welcome back to a new video.  

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,760
And as always I want to thank all the nice 
people that support this channel on steady.  

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:14,480
The topic for today is functional analysis 
because this is the one most of you voted for.  

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,800
Therefore now I have a whole serious planned to 
get into the real interesting stuff concerning  

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,280
functional analysis. What you should know is 
that functional analysis is a really wide field.  

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,720
However to get an idea what it is about 
you can just look at these two blocks.  

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,120
On the one side you have the linear algebra and 
on the other side you have the real or complex  

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,000
analysis. In a rough sense if you look at infinite 
dimensional spaces in the linear algebra sense,  

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,960
and if you want to apply some analysis for these 
spaces, then you are on the realm of functional  

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,840
analysis. Of course there's much more to it but 
if you have some knowledge in linear algebra and  

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:07,280
analysis now you know what to expect. For example 
here we consider spaces consisting of functions  

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,880
or of sequences and of course also 
linear maps between such spaces.  

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,280
Because in this field we always combine 
algebraic structures with analytic properties,  

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,200
one often summarizes functional analysis just by 
saying: it's the study of topological algebraic  

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,560
structures. Don't worry what this exactly means 
we will clear up in the next videos. However what  

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,880
you should see here is that topology plays a role 
here and indeed it's not a bad idea to start with  

17
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,560
topology when dealing with functional analysis. 
However that's not what I want to do here  

18
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,080
because I want to start with something that 
is closer to a normal analysis course. And  

19
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:57,440
that is the structure we call a metric space. A 
so-called metric space is not at all complicated:  

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:06,720
we start with a set X and we visualize that as a 
collection of points. For example, in the set X  

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:14,720
we have a lowercase point x, so just an element 
in our set and another element we can call y.  

22
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,640
If we just consider a set, we can't say 
anything about these points other than:  

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,600
they are equal or not. So there are different 
points but we don't know anything more than that.  

24
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,240
Now this is what we now want to 
change: we want to give the set  

25
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:37,440
X more structure. In this case, we want to know 
what the distance between two chosen points is.  

26
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,360
Now if we want such a distance then of course 
it should fulfill some reasonable properties.  

27
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,400
For example, if we choose two distinct points, 
then the distance should be always positive.  

28
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,520
Of course the distance could also be zero but 
only in the case when x and y are the same point.  

29
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:06,400
In order to formalize that, we have to write down 
a map. This map is called a metric and it measures  

30
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,120
distances and now it gets two points, so it lives 
on the Cartesian product of X with X. And it  

31
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:22,000
maps into the non-negative real numbers, so zero 
infinity, where zero is included. Now such a map  

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,720
we call a metric if it fulfills three properties. 
And the first one we already know. If the distance  

33
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,640
between two points is exactly zero, then this 
is only if and only the case if x is equal to y.  

34
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,600
The second property is also very descriptive. 
So if we look again at two points x and y.  

35
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,440
And now we measure the distance from x to y. And 
of course this should be the same as starting by y  

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,320
and going to x. So the distance from y to x 
should be the same as the distance from x to y.  

37
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,640
This means for the map it is symmetric: it does 
not matter which is the first and which is the  

38
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:12,560
second element. You get the same result. And now 
the last property is very important it is called  

39
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,680
the triangle inequality. The name already tells 
you now we consider three points instead of two,  

40
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:27,840
so there's a point z. Now we have a distance from 
x to z, and also distance from z to y. Now the  

41
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:35,760
triangle inequality tells you if you go a detour, 
then your distance gets longer. In other words if  

42
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:43,760
you add the gray length, then it gets longer than 
the blue line here. In a formal way this means:  

43
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:55,840
d(x, y), the blue line, is less or equal 
than distance x to z plus distance z to y.  

44
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,440
Now with such a map, we can now 
measure all the distances in the set X.  

45
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:08,720
Therefore we call the set X with the metric 
d a metric space. And you already know  

46
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,120
if we can measure distances, we can do a lot of 
analytical stuff. And this is what we will do  

47
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,120
in the next videos. So please use the comments 
to tell me what you want to see in a functional  

48
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:37,840
analysis course. So thanks for listening and 
hopefully, I see you in the next videos. Bye!

49
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:58,900
you
