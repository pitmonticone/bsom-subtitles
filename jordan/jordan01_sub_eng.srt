Hello and welcome to this video about a topic in 
linear algebra and as always first I want to thank

0:00:07.890,0:00:14.580
all the nice people that support this channel 
on Steady. The topic for today is the so-called

0:00:14.580,0:00:21.990
Jordan normal form. This one is such an important 
problem that I will do a couple of videos about it.

0:00:21.990,0:00:28.890
This one is now part 1 where I want to talk a 
little bit about the concept of the Jordan normal

0:00:28.890,0:00:35.460
form. Now I should immediately mention that the 
name comes from an French mathematician called

0:00:35.460,0:00:43.110
Camille Jordan. However since most people use the 
English pronunciation I will also do this for

0:00:43.110,0:00:52.500
these videos. Ok so let's start with something you 
should already know. Now let A be a square matrix

0:00:52.500,0:01:03.000
with real or complex numbers as entries. Then we 
call A diagonalizable if there is an invertible

0:01:03.000,0:01:10.050
matrix X of the same size such that this matrix 
transforms the matrix A into a diagonal matrix.

0:01:10.050,0:01:23.850
More concretely, this means X inverse A X equals a
diagonal matrix D, or equivalently we can say that

0:01:23.850,0:01:35.370
we can decompose the matrix A into 3 matrices X 
then D and then X inverse. Therefore this is what

0:01:35.370,0:01:43.050
we call a matrix decomposition, and it might be 
helpful for a lot of calculations. For example if

0:01:43.050,0:01:49.770
you want to calculate powers of the matrix A, you 
can just use this decomposition and essentially

0:01:49.770,0:01:56.010
you just need the powers of the diagonal matrix 
D, which is very easy because you just have the

0:01:56.010,0:02:03.090
entries on the diagonal where you calculate 
the powers of these numbers. However this only

0:02:03.090,0:02:11.190
works in the special case where the matrix A is 
diagonalizable. Therefore the natural question

0:02:11.190,0:02:18.600
would be how can we generalize that for all 
square matrices. And we will find out that the

0:02:18.600,0:02:25.470
correct substitution in the general case would 
be to choose here a Jordan normal form. Now I can

0:02:25.470,0:02:33.660
already tell you that in our context such Jordan 
normal form always exists which means if I choose

0:02:33.660,0:02:42.480
a square matrix with complex-valued entries, 
then we have always a Jordan normal form.

0:02:42.480,0:02:51.240
Two important things I should point out here: first I 
speak of a Jordan normal form which means J is not

0:02:51.240,0:02:57.300
uniquely given in general there could be several 
Jordan normal forms which should be similar in

0:02:57.300,0:03:04.650
some sense. Secondly the complex numbers on the 
left also include the real numbers so we could

0:03:04.650,0:03:12.330
have a matrix a which only has real numbers as 
entries. However this does not necessarily mean

0:03:12.330,0:03:21.930
that also J has only real numbers as entries. Here 
we maybe really need two complex numbers. Okay if

0:03:21.930,0:03:28.770
we have a Jordan normal form, it also means we have 
an invertible matrix X as before such that we have

0:03:28.770,0:03:38.130
the matrix decomposition.Please also note if A is 
diagonalizable, this Jordan normal form has to be the

0:03:38.130,0:03:45.870
diagonal matrix from before. So we have indeed a 
generalization: J could be a diagonal matrix but in

0:03:45.870,0:03:54.780
general it is not. Okay let's look at an example. I 
want to choose a matrix which is large enough such

0:03:54.780,0:04:02.820
that we can talk about all possible cases that can 
happen. So I choose a matrix which is 9 times 9 and

0:04:02.820,0:04:12.930
now I assume that we already know the eigenvalues 
of A. I want 2 3 & 4 as eigenvalues and I also

0:04:12.930,0:04:18.720
want to know the algebraic multiplicities 
and we choose the algebraic multiplicity of

0:04:18.720,0:04:32.510
2 as 3 and 4 for 3 and 2 for 4. So please remember the 
algebraic multiplicity is by definition how

0:04:32.510,0:04:40.940
often one finds the eigenvalue as a zero in the 
characteristic polynomial. Hence if we add up all

0:04:40.940,0:04:49.220
the algebraic multiplicities we have to get out 9 
again. Therefore we know such a case can happen and

0:04:49.220,0:04:57.260
now we can think about different possibilities.
If the matrix A was diagnosable, we would find

0:04:57.260,0:05:04.010
as a Jordan normal form just a diagonal matrix 
where we find these eigenvalues on the diagonal.

0:05:04.010,0:05:10.700
Of course, there are different possibilities for 
the order of these eigenvalues, but we know

0:05:10.700,0:05:17.690
how often there should occur, exactly with the 
algebraic multiplicities. However what we really want

0:05:17.690,0:05:25.100
for the Jordan normal form is to group the same 
eigenvalues. In addition as an option you could

0:05:25.100,0:05:32.540
say I also want that the eigenvalues increase 
and then indeed the order is fixed. Putting the

0:05:32.540,0:05:39.410
eigenvalues into these groups is what we 
usually call Jordan blocks. This means that

0:05:39.410,0:05:45.920
we have exactly three Jordan blocks here: for each 
distinct eigenvalue we have exactly one Jordan

0:05:45.920,0:05:53.030
block. Hence the first thing you should remember is 
that the algebraic multiplicity gives you the size

0:05:53.030,0:05:59.900
of the corresponding Jordan block. So you see this 
is the first step in a Jordan normal form we have

0:05:59.900,0:06:07.670
such Jordan blocks on the diagonal. Of course the 
interesting thing is now what happens inside such

0:06:07.670,0:06:13.190
a Jordan block but I can already tell you they 
are independent so it does not matter with which

0:06:13.190,0:06:21.920
one you start your calculations. Okay then let's 
start discussing the red one: since we didn't fix

0:06:21.920,0:06:28.490
the matrix A, I just gave you the eigenvalues 
and the algebraic multiplicities, we can't do

0:06:28.490,0:06:36.320
any calculations, but we can look which different 
possibilities could happen. To be more precise, we

0:06:36.320,0:06:44.990
have these Jordan blocks and the size, but we don't 
know what is up here inside the block, but we know

0:06:44.990,0:06:51.950
there are only a few possibilities. The first case 
I already mentioned: we could have diagonalizable

0:06:51.950,0:07:00.440
matrix A which means for this block here we have 
zeros outside of the diagonal with 2s. We usually

0:07:00.440,0:07:07.220
emphasize that by drawing a new box here where 
all the nonzero numbers are. So we have one box

0:07:07.220,0:07:17.120
here, we have one small box here, and one here. And 
these are now called Jordan boxes inside the big

0:07:17.120,0:07:24.050
Jordan block. Now we already know where this comes 
from because, besides of the algebraic multiplicity,

0:07:24.050,0:07:31.100
we also have the geometric multiplicity. And 
because we are here in the diagonalizable case,

0:07:31.100,0:07:38.660
we know the geometric multiplicity has to be the 
same as the algebraic multiplicity. So here 3. And

0:07:38.660,0:07:46.580
this 3 corresponds to the 3 Jordan boxes inside 
the block. Hence you might have already have

0:07:46.580,0:07:53.360
guessed that we find different cases for different 
geometric multiplicities. So the next case would be

0:07:53.360,0:08:01.700
geometric multiplicity of 2 which already means 
that we just have two Jordan boxes. Please note

0:08:01.700,0:08:09.800
from the geometric multiplicity we only know the 
number of the boxes not the size, but here we don't

0:08:09.800,0:08:18.410
have any choice. We know we can have one box of 
size two and one of size one. Of course, we could

0:08:18.410,0:08:24.080
change the order of the boxes, but this would be 
essentially the same so normally we would ignore

0:08:24.080,0:08:33.080
the order. Most importantly here to remember is 
that in a Jordan box above the diagonal you always

0:08:33.080,0:08:41.870
find 1s. So, here would be one one. Okay and the 
last case here is of course just having one Jordan

0:08:41.870,0:08:52.220
box. So geometric multiplicity of one means one 
box fills out the whole Jordan block. This also

0:08:52.220,0:08:59.330
means that we have the ones above the diagonal 
so one here and here the other one. And now these

0:08:59.330,0:09:06.770
are all the three possibilities we have for our 
three times three Jordan block. Here the geometric

0:09:06.770,0:09:13.820
multiplicity tells us in which case we are. However 
this will change now if we look at it four times

0:09:13.820,0:09:20.930
for Jordan block. Okay then let's copy the light 
blue one here and then of course the first case

0:09:20.930,0:09:27.920
would be to have four small Jordan boxes. As before 
this corresponds to the geometric multiplicity

0:09:27.920,0:09:34.940
of four and then we don't have any other choice 
than to choose the smallest Jordan box here which

0:09:34.940,0:09:41.660
means one times one and then we can have four of 
them. A similar thing happens now if we look at

0:09:41.660,0:09:49.490
the geometric multiplicity of 3. So we have three 
boxes. Here you see if we want three boxes we need

0:09:49.490,0:09:58.220
one two times two box and two one times one boxes. 
As before if we are not interested in the order

0:09:58.220,0:10:05.840
of the boxes, this one is the only possibility for 
geometric multiplicity of three. Okay and of course

0:10:05.840,0:10:14.150
we don't forget the one here. Now in the next case 
so geometric multiplicity of 2, we have indeed two

0:10:14.150,0:10:20.150
different possibilities. Maybe that's not so 
surprising because if you want to choose two

0:10:20.150,0:10:28.460
Jordan boxes, you can immediately see that you can 
choose two big ones so this one and this one or

0:10:28.460,0:10:37.850
you choose a very large one, so a three times three 
box and a small one. They are indeed different now

0:10:37.850,0:10:44.930
because the sizes don't coincide. Now this is 
very important to note: in this case it's not

0:10:44.930,0:10:51.410
sufficient to know just the algebraic and the 
geometric multiplicity to conclude how the Jordan

0:10:51.410,0:10:58.640
block has to look. It was sufficient in the case 
of above because the block was very small. Here the

0:10:58.640,0:11:04.400
block is bigger but it's still sufficient to know 
the geometric and algebraic multiplicity here and

0:11:04.400,0:11:11.980
here but not here anymore. And that's important 
because you have to know where you need more

0:11:11.980,0:11:19.180
calculations than just the multiplicities. Okay 
so you have seen an example here and of course

0:11:19.180,0:11:23.770
for the sake of completeness I give you here the 
last possibility when the geometric multiplicity

0:11:23.770,0:11:32.020
is just 1. However this always means the same we 
just have one box so the box fills out the whole

0:11:32.020,0:11:39.220
Jordan block. Well maybe that's good enough for 
an introduction how the Jordan normal form looks

0:11:39.220,0:11:46.810
like. For the end of this video I want to give you 
a short recipe how to calculate the Jordan normal

0:11:46.810,0:11:53.800
form for a given matrix. And in the next video 
I will do this then in all detail with a good

0:11:53.800,0:12:00.160
example. Ok so the first step here you already 
know you have to calculate all the eigenvalues.

0:12:00.160,0:12:08.500
So maybe we call them just lambda with index 1 2 
and so on and we say they are all different and

0:12:08.500,0:12:16.900
we have K of them. I've already told you the Jordan 
blocks which means the eigenvalues are independent

0:12:16.900,0:12:23.290
so you can start with any of them. However in the 
end you have to do it for all of them so the next

0:12:23.290,0:12:29.920
steps you do for all eigenvalues separately. 
This step you might have already done you

0:12:29.920,0:12:37.330
look how often occurs lambda i as a zero in the 
characteristic polynomial and then you calculate

0:12:37.330,0:12:44.710
the geometric multiplicity of lambda i and this 
one is nothing more than calculating the kernel

0:12:44.710,0:12:54.250
of the matrix minus lambda i times the identity 
matrix where use this one here. And then we look

0:12:54.250,0:13:00.400
at the dimension: the dimension of the eigenspace 
which is this kernel is exactly the geometric

0:13:00.400,0:13:07.360
multiplicity. Now from the discussion above you 
know you might be already finished here because

0:13:07.360,0:13:14.770
in some cases the Jordan block is determined just 
by the algebraic and geometric multiplicity. If not

0:13:14.770,0:13:24.710
we need the next step where you calculate the 
next powers of A - lambda i identity matrix so

0:13:24.710,0:13:31.400
first you would square the matrix then look at 
the kernel and then calculate the dimension of

0:13:31.400,0:13:39.470
this one. There you get more information and indeed 
in general you have to calculate all these powers

0:13:39.470,0:13:45.500
until this dimension does not change any more.
If you have never seen that before it might

0:13:45.500,0:13:52.430
look complicated but in the next video we'll see 
it is not. For the end I should also mention that

0:13:52.430,0:14:01.280
we just talked about the Jordan normal form J but 
not about the matrix X. Again remember we wanted

0:14:01.280,0:14:08.390
this matrix decomposition. Now if we also want to 
calculate this matrix X which is invertible we

0:14:08.390,0:14:14.450
have to do a little bit more than just this 
recipe. Here this is what I also show you in

0:14:14.450,0:14:20.180
another video and I will also show you there an 
example so that you get a feeling how to calculate

0:14:20.180,0:14:27.230
everything. Okay so that's good enough for today 
so thanks for listening and see you next time bye

0:14:52.150,0:14:52.650
you
