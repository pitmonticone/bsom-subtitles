00:00:00,389 --> 00:00:01,970
 Hello and welcome to

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,569
 start learning logic.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,369
 And as always, many thanks

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,530
 to all the nice people that

5
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:08,090
 support this channel on Steady

6
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,890
 or paypal.

7
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,800
 This is part one where I

8
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,090
 want to show you the basic

9
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,500
 stuff you need to know about

10
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,050
 logic to understand

11
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:15,770
 mathematics.

12
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:17,319
 Therefore, we don't need

13
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:18,639
 to go into the details of

14
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:20,370
 the wide field of logic and

15
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:21,309
 formal logic.

16
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,120
 For us, it would be sufficient

17
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:24,559
 to understand logical

18
00:00:24,569 --> 00:00:26,520
 statements and logical operations.

19
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,649
 Since a lot of people can

20
00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:30,590
 correctly deal with the everyday

21
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,520
 logic on an intuitive level,

22
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,310
 this is often skipped when

23
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:35,700
 you start with mathematics.

24
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:37,509
 However, I think it's important

25
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,130
 to see that we have the logic

26
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,830
 as the foundation because

27
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,619
 we need to define everything

28
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,110
 in an unambiguous way in

29
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:44,869
 mathematics.

30
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,919
 Hence, for us, our starting

31
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,319
 point would be logical

32
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,950
 statements also called

33
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:50,759
 propositions.

34
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,000
 Now, such a proposition is

35
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:54,700
 just a statement which means

36
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:56,159
 a meaningful declarative

37
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:57,400
 sentence that has a

38
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:59,000
 well-defined truth value.

39
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,560
 So it can be either a true

40
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:02,819
 or a false statement.

41
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,550
 Therefore, when you take

42
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,029
 examples outside the

43
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,410
 mathematical world, you have

44
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:09,029
 to be careful what really

45
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,550
 satisfies this condition

46
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:10,900
 here.

47
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,349
 So you can't take any opinions

48
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,860
 or questions because a

49
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,209
 question does not have a

50
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,750
 well-defined truth value.

51
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:18,860
 OK.

52
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,529
 Then let's look at some examples

53
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,690
 where you should always keep

54
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:23,069
 in mind that we first have

55
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,809
 to agree on some definitions

56
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,309
 such that the examples make

57
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:26,690
 sense.

58
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,459
 So here Mars is a planet

59
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,900
 is a logical statement.

60
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,699
 When we know what object

61
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:34,440
 we call Mars and what a

62
00:01:34,449 --> 00:01:35,779
 planet is by definition.

63
00:01:36,419 --> 00:01:38,110
 Then this logical statement

64
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,379
 is indeed true.

65
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:41,709
 In this way, we can also

66
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,489
 formulate the sentence Pluto

67
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,879
 is a planet which is by the

68
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:46,830
 same agreement also a logical

69
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:47,430
 statement.

70
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,489
 However, this one now has

71
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,069
 the truth value false.

72
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,440
 So you see such real world

73
00:01:53,449 --> 00:01:54,849
 examples can really help

74
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,290
 to understand the concepts.

75
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,940
 But of course, they can lead

76
00:01:57,949 --> 00:01:59,169
 to some discussions.

77
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,750
 Therefore, I prefer examples

78
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,419
 in mathematics because they

79
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,069
 are all definitions are given.

80
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,510
 For example, we could choose

81
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,360
 the sentence one plus

82
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,270
 one is equal to two.

83
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,589
 Of course, here you also

84
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,979
 have to know what the numbers

85
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,250
 mean, what the plus sign

86
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:16,500
 means and what the equality

87
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:17,119
 sign means.

88
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,350
 But if you know these things,

89
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,740
 you know, this is a true

90
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,020
 logical statement.

91
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,490
 Of course, such logical statements

92
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,020
 coming from mathematics can

93
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:27,940
 also be formulated with English

94
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:28,440
 words.

95
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,300
 For example, we could say

96
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,919
 the number five is smaller

97
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:32,979
 than the number two.

98
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,940
 So here we need only knowledge

99
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:36,309
 of the natural numbers and

100
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,250
 how they are ordered.

101
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,710
 Then you can say yes, this

102
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,220
 is also a logical statement,

103
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,380
 but it is false.

104
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:43,449
 OK.

105
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,289
 Then let's go to a counterexample.

106
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,160
 What about good morning?

107
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,130
 Of course, this seems very

108
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:51,089
 nice, but we can't associate

109
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,419
 a well-defined truth value

110
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:52,809
 to it.

111
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,000
 It simply does not make sense

112
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,350
 to say that this one here

113
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,240
 is true or that it is false.

114
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:00,520
 So it's clearly not a logical

115
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:01,080
 statement.

116
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,419
 Another example now in the

117
00:03:03,429 --> 00:03:04,679
 mathematical world would

118
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,160
 be to say I have a variable

119
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:08,080
 X plus one and

120
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:09,699
 this is equal to one.

121
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:11,419
 So this might be a tricky

122
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:13,300
 one because it's not a logical

123
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:13,860
 statement.

124
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:15,460
 Despite looking like one.

125
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:17,410
 The reason for this is that

126
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:19,250
 the variable X here is not

127
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:19,850
 fixed.

128
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,559
 So we can't give the statement

129
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,250
 a well defined truth value

130
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:24,869
 because it would depend what

131
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,889
 X really is.

132
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:28,490
 This means that in the moment

133
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,039
 that X gets a value,

134
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,509
 this statement becomes a

135
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,600
 logical statement.

136
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:34,669
 Of course, such constructions

137
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:36,440
 are all over mathematics.

138
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:37,889
 Therefore, they will be important

139
00:03:37,899 --> 00:03:39,440
 later and we call such a

140
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:40,669
 thing a pretty kit.

141
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,820
 Now, the next step is when

142
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,600
 we have such logical statements,

143
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,399
 we also want to combine them,

144
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,389
 they are just called logical

145
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,639
 operations and they give

146
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:51,440
 us new logical statements.

147
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:53,500
 For example, the negation

148
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:55,059
 is defined for given

149
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,899
 logical statement A which

150
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,479
 could be, for example, one

151
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,970
 plus one is equal to two.

152
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,440
 Then the new logical statement,

153
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:04,210
 the negation of A is denoted

154
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,110
 by this line.

155
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,100
 In front of A, you should

156
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,740
 read it as not A and it

157
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,160
 simply switches the truth

158
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:10,740
 value.

159
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:12,240
 Therefore, the best thing

160
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,100
 to define such a logic operation

161
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,699
 is to use a so called truth

162
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,220
 table where we put in all

163
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,820
 possible inputs and the

164
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,059
 corresponding outcomes.

165
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:22,158
 Of course, here we only have

166
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:22,998
 two inputs.

167
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:24,838
 A could be either true or

168
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:25,378
 false.

169
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:26,919
 So the truth value should

170
00:04:26,928 --> 00:04:27,618
 be switched.

171
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:29,378
 So not a should be false

172
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:30,989
 when A is true and the other

173
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:31,579
 way around.

174
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:32,619
 OK.

175
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,959
 Also here let's look at some

176
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,660
 examples to get an idea what

177
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,739
 we are talking about.

178
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,380
 So let's take the logical

179
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,019
 statement A given by the

180
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,380
 English sentence, the wine

181
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,290
 bottle is full.

182
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,579
 Then the negation of A is

183
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:46,140
 simply given by putting in

184
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:47,660
 the word not into the

185
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,190
 sentence.

186
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,209
 Of course, here we assume

187
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,299
 that you know which wine

188
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:52,809
 bottle we talk about and

189
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,910
 what full means.

190
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,549
 But then you see negation

191
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,220
 is very easy just putting

192
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,989
 in not at the correct position.

193
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:01,019
 An important thing to note

194
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:02,390
 here is that this is not

195
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,140
 the same as saying the wine

196
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:05,420
 bottle is empty.

197
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,320
 In other words, negation

198
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:08,630
 does not mean the complete

199
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,269
 opposite.

200
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,899
 It just means switching it

201
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,670
 to values.

202
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,519
 As another example, let's

203
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:14,929
 consider the logical statement

204
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,890
 A S two plus two

205
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,209
 is equal to five,

206
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,709
 then not A is of course two

207
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,589
 plus two is not equal

208
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,279
 to five.

209
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:25,059
 Now, what you might think

210
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,420
 is we just have to look at

211
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:28,140
 the second line here because

212
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:29,700
 we already know A is

213
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:30,380
 false.

214
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,269
 So not A should be just a

215
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,059
 true statement.

216
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:34,600
 However, that's not what

217
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:35,700
 the negation does.

218
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,670
 It considers both cases at

219
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:38,470
 the same time.

220
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,260
 This means that if we live

221
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:41,670
 in a strange world where

222
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:43,059
 this logical statement is

223
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,739
 true, then the negation

224
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,260
 here should also be

225
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:47,019
 false.

226
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,869
 Therefore, please always

227
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,489
 consider these two possible

228
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,869
 worlds, which means these

229
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,769
 two lines here.

230
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,010
 Then if you get the correct

231
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:56,529
 truth table, you've found

232
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,609
 the correct negation.

233
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,540
 Besides the negation, we

234
00:05:59,549 --> 00:06:00,880
 have another fundamental

235
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,329
 logic operation, which is

236
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:03,619
 called the conjunction.

237
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,339
 It combines two logical statements,

238
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,989
 let's call them A and

239
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,470
 B.

240
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,480
 And then the conjunction

241
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:12,329
 is defined by this wedge

242
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,739
 symbol in between.

243
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,589
 You should read it as A and

244
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,279
 B because it's the end

245
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,989
 operation, which means this

246
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,510
 one is only true.

247
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,179
 If A and B are

248
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,549
 true simultaneously

249
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:26,269
 with this information, you

250
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,549
 are already able to write

251
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,190
 down the whole truth table

252
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,470
 which you would see as the

253
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,450
 correct definition.

254
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,649
 Now, instead of two rows,

255
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,220
 we have four rows because

256
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,200
 we have four possible combinations

257
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:38,989
 of the two values of A and

258
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,380
 B.

259
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,399
 Now from bottom to top, you

260
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,109
 know, this one is false because

261
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:44,589
 we have at least one false

262
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,149
 here, the same here

263
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:47,429
 and the same here.

264
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,109
 Everything's false except

265
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:50,029
 the first row.

266
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,709
 This one is true because

267
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,750
 both are true.

268
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,880
 A good visualization for

269
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,440
 the and operation would be

270
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,279
 to consider a circuit

271
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,880
 with a lamp and a battery.

272
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:01,760
 Now, what we can do is to

273
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:03,329
 put A and B as

274
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:05,200
 switches into the circuit.

275
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,540
 In this picture, false should

276
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:09,279
 mean off and true should

277
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,179
 mean on and the

278
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,940
 lamp we see is our output.

279
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,890
 So here you see, we need

280
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:16,820
 both switches to be on to

281
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:18,369
 get an on output.

282
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,329
 So true means true,

283
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:22,209
 otherwise we are false.

284
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:23,450
 OK.

285
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:24,559
 In the next video I show

286
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,279
 you other logical operations

287
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,880
 that are also very important

288
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,820
 in mathematics.

289
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,570
 So I hope I see you there

290
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:31,839
 and have a nice day.

291
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,630
 Bye.
