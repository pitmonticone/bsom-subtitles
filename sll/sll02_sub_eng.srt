00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,099
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,109 --> 00:00:03,460
 start learning logic.

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,900
 Now with part two.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,820
 And first, I want to thank

5
00:00:06,829 --> 00:00:08,350
 all the nice people on Steady

6
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:10,170
 or paypal who support this

7
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:10,649
 channel.

8
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:12,899
 Now to refresh your memory.

9
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:14,300
 Last time we learned the

10
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,100
 meaning of logical statements

11
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,180
 and we used the names A and

12
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,459
 B to denote them.

13
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:21,409
 And then we have seen that

14
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,180
 we can formulate new logical

15
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,850
 statements with the negation

16
00:00:25,049 --> 00:00:26,090
 and the conjunction.

17
00:00:26,979 --> 00:00:28,639
 These two new symbols, we

18
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:30,290
 called logical operations.

19
00:00:30,389 --> 00:00:31,920
 And this one was the not

20
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,830
 operation and this one, the

21
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,720
 and operation.

22
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,049
 Now, if you have such a formula

23
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,669
 with logical operations,

24
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,319
 the original statements A

25
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,090
 and B are often just

26
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:43,650
 called logical variables

27
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:44,409
 in this case.

28
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:46,250
 So you see we have a lot

29
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:47,889
 of vocabulary which is in

30
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,209
 the end, maybe not so

31
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:49,970
 important.

32
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:51,090
 The important thing will

33
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:52,919
 be that you understand all

34
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,130
 the symbols we use.

35
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,270
 OK.

36
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:56,939
 Then let's continue introducing

37
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,619
 more symbols with logical

38
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,330
 operations.

39
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:01,490
 The next one is the so called

40
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,229
 disjunction also defined

41
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,730
 for two logical statements

42
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,750
 A and B.

43
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,379
 And it's similar to the end

44
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:09,069
 operation here because it's

45
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,349
 the or operation,

46
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:12,470
 the symbol we use here is

47
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,339
 the flipped one.

48
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:14,680
 So just a V

49
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,540
 as in the last video, we

50
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,300
 can define the symbol by

51
00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:19,800
 writing down the truth table.

52
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,519
 The disjunction should be

53
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:23,019
 two when at least one of

54
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:24,760
 the two constituents is two.

55
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,230
 So we have two here, two

56
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:27,779
 here.

57
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,919
 And also the first line because

58
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,489
 both of them are two and

59
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,940
 we don't have an exclusive

60
00:01:32,949 --> 00:01:33,519
 or here.

61
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,510
 However, when both of them

62
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,319
 are false, we have a false

63
00:01:38,029 --> 00:01:39,419
 similar to the conjunction.

64
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,059
 You can also visualize this

65
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:43,019
 with a circuit and a lamp.

66
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,260
 In this case, the two switches

67
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:46,910
 just have to be parallel.

68
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,879
 Now having these logical

69
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:50,790
 operations, we can combine

70
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,349
 them in a lot of ways to

71
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,190
 get out new logical statements.

72
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,989
 Therefore, the natural thing

73
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,900
 to do is writing down a truth

74
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,349
 table for such a new

75
00:01:59,360 --> 00:01:59,970
 combination.

76
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,449
 So let's consider a simple

77
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,269
 example here.

78
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:05,650
 What about not A

79
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,500
 or a?

80
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:09,089
 You see what we usually assume

81
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,000
 is that the NOT operator

82
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:12,300
 binds closest.

83
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:13,389
 Therefore, we don't need

84
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,699
 any parentheses here.

85
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:16,759
 Now, in this example, our

86
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,479
 combination just has one

87
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,190
 logic variable which means

88
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,860
 our truth table just needs

89
00:02:21,869 --> 00:02:22,839
 two rows.

90
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:23,720
 OK?

91
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:24,779
 So let's fill that in.

92
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:26,600
 We know that not just flips

93
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,490
 the truth values and

94
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,419
 now the or just needs one

95
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:30,949
 true.

96
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,809
 So we have the true here and

97
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,580
 the true here.

98
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,529
 Now you see this

99
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:37,339
 combination always gets you

100
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,119
 a true statement out no

101
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,500
 matter what the truth value

102
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:41,809
 of the input A was.

103
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,880
 In logic, we call such a

104
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:45,610
 thing a tautology.

105
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,619
 So it's a combination of

106
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,509
 logical operations and logical

107
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,460
 variables that is always

108
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,240
 true no matter what the truth

109
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,910
 values are of the logical

110
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,529
 variables that are contained

111
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:57,369
 in the formula.

112
00:02:57,869 --> 00:02:59,330
 Of course, this was a simple

113
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:00,050
 example.

114
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:01,770
 You could have many different

115
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:03,169
 logical variables in the

116
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:03,770
 formula.

117
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,119
 But then the truth table

118
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,270
 would be much bigger.

119
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,119
 Of course, knowing which

120
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,850
 combinations are tautologies is

121
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,419
 very helpful because you

122
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:13,020
 always can substitute this

123
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:13,630
 combination.

124
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,199
 Then with just a true

125
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,419
 now related to that is the

126
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:18,960
 notion of logical

127
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,820
 equivalence.

128
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,179
 It also tells you when you

129
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,050
 can substitute one formula

130
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,979
 with another, we

131
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,699
 call two logical statements.

132
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,300
 So combinations as we had

133
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,830
 before, logically

134
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:32,410
 equivalent, if the truth

135
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:33,830
 table looks the same for

136
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,250
 both more

137
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:36,529
 concretely, you have to look

138
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:38,139
 at all possible assignments

139
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:40,119
 of truth values for the logical

140
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,839
 variables that are included

141
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,020
 in both formulas.

142
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,360
 And if you get the same output

143
00:03:45,369 --> 00:03:47,130
 for both formulas, we call

144
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,820
 them logically equivalent.

145
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:49,880
 OK?

146
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,270
 So it looks like a reasonable

147
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:51,800
 term.

148
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:53,520
 But to understand it, I think

149
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:54,960
 we should look at an example

150
00:03:55,809 --> 00:03:56,169
 here.

151
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:58,020
 I want to consider A or

152
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,619
 B with a NOT in

153
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,440
 front and

154
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,309
 also not A

155
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,779
 and not B.

156
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,029
 So please keep in mind we

157
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,910
 need parentheses here, but

158
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,550
 not here.

159
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:11,850
 But of course, if you want,

160
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,610
 you are allowed to use them

161
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:13,960
 here.

162
00:04:14,899 --> 00:04:16,600
 OK, then let's do a large

163
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:17,480
 truth table.

164
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,730
 Of course, we need here our

165
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,548
 inputs A and B

166
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:23,170
 and the outputs on the right

167
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:23,779
 hand side.

168
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:25,559
 Then in the next step, we

169
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,209
 can fill in all possible

170
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,619
 combinations of the truth

171
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,029
 values of the logical

172
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,750
 variables.

173
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,809
 Afterwards, we have to think

174
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,350
 what are good intermediate

175
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:36,010
 steps to reach our result.

176
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:37,890
 On the right hand side here.

177
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,170
 For example, I would say

178
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:41,010
 we calculate first A or

179
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,769
 B for this, we

180
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,239
 already know the truth table.

181
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,089
 We have true true true

182
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,760
 false.

183
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,579
 And then we just have to

184
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,200
 use the negation which

185
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:51,950
 switches all the truth values.

186
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,750
 So we have False False False

187
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,279
 true.

188
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,059
 So now we finish with the

189
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,940
 first one.

190
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,070
 And for the second one, I

191
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,440
 would say we first write

192
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,399
 down not A and afterwards

193
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,679
 we write down not B

194
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:03,820
 OK.

195
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:05,040
 Filling this in was not so

196
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:06,559
 hard because we already know

197
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,519
 how to do this.

198
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,119
 And now for the last step,

199
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,119
 we have to use the and operator

200
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,839
 in the first line, we have

201
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,899
 false and false.

202
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,820
 So this is false, then we

203
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:17,420
 have false and two still

204
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:18,010
 false.

205
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:19,790
 Then we have two and false

206
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:20,929
 still false.

207
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:22,170
 And in the last line, we

208
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:23,829
 have two and two, which is

209
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,239
 two.

210
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,529
 And there we have our result,

211
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,010
 the truth values for both

212
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:29,390
 combinations match

213
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,089
 completely.

214
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,500
 In other words, they are

215
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,100
 logically equivalent.

216
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:36,130
 And the symbol we use for

217
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,660
 this is this double

218
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:39,529
 arrow for

219
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:39,690
 you.

220
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,920
 This means if you have a

221
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:42,670
 large formula as a logical

222
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:43,929
 statement where you have

223
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,269
 this part inside,

224
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,290
 you can easily substitute

225
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:49,010
 this with this one without

226
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:50,489
 changing the truth value

227
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:52,359
 and also the other way around.

228
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:54,399
 So the logical equivalence

229
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,630
 is what you can use to

230
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,239
 simplify a complicated

231
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,029
 expression step by step.

232
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,589
 Of course, we will see examples

233
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,070
 of this.

234
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,529
 But first, I want to use

235
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,160
 the next video to show you

236
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,700
 more logical operations.

237
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:08,760
 So I hope I see you there

238
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,089
 and have a nice day.

239
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:10,850
 Bye.
