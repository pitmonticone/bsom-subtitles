00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,150
 Hello and welcome to this

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,819
 video about linear algebra.

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,230
 And as always many, many

4
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:06,800
 thanks to all the nice people

5
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:07,989
 that support me on Steady

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,819
 or paypal.

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,699
 If you want a PDF version

8
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,329
 of this video, the link is

9
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,779
 in the description. Today's

10
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:15,239
 topic is the so-called

11
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,639
 plu decomposition

12
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:17,299
 for matrices.

13
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:19,780
 You can see this as a supplemental

14
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,270
 video if you have already

15
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,780
 watched my video about the

16
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,979
 LU decomposition.

17
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,209
 In other words, this is just

18
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:27,280
 a generalization.

19
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:29,600
 However, L still stands for

20
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,090
 a lower triangular matrix.

21
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,000
 Hence it's always a square

22
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:34,709
 matrix but

23
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,349
 U in general is not a

24
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,040
 square matrix because it

25
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:39,360
 always needs to be of the

26
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:41,159
 same size as the original

27
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:42,959
 matrix we want to decompose.

28
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:44,759
 So what we want to get out

29
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,290
 here is this so-called row

30
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,529
 echelon form.

31
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,259
 Please note for a square

32
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,750
 matrix, this would be an

33
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,240
 upper triangular matrix.

34
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,720
 So we still denote it by

35
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:54,099
 U.

36
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,080
 And the last ingredient we

37
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,709
 have here is the matrix P

38
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,290
 which saves all the row

39
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:00,729
 exchanges we have to do.

40
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,389
 Therefore, this is what we

41
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,309
 call a permutation matrix.

42
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:04,870
 OK.

43
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,209
 Now you know the three parts

44
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,269
 of the decomposition.

45
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:08,949
 So let's calculate them for

46
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,709
 an example, I want the

47
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,610
 matrix A to be a four times

48
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,669
 five matrix

49
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
 there we have it.

50
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:16,730
 This is the matrix I have

51
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:17,760
 chosen for today.

52
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,580
 Now, if you want to start

53
00:01:19,589 --> 00:01:21,120
 here with your common LU

54
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,739
 decomposition, you immediately

55
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,739
 find the problem.

56
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,809
 You can't use the zero as

57
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,599
 a pivot to eliminate all

58
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:28,639
 the other numbers in the

59
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,500
 first column.

60
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,000
 Hence, the first step you

61
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,569
 need to do is to go through

62
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,550
 the column to find a nonzero

63
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:36,279
 element to use as a pivot.

64
00:01:37,309 --> 00:01:37,720
 OK.

65
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,279
 We find it in the *second* row.

66
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,910
 Therefore, we need to exchange

67
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:42,180
 the first and the second

68
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,550
 row.

69
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,620
 Now a permutation matrix

70
00:01:44,629 --> 00:01:46,489
 that exchanges row one with

71
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,339
 row two looks like this.

72
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:50,220
 It's simply a four times

73
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,769
 four identity matrix where

74
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,160
 we flip the two rows, we're

75
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:55,089
 interested in an important

76
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,940
 property is now if we square

77
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:58,839
 that matrix, we get out our

78
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:00,220
 identity matrix.

79
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:01,750
 Hence, this is our first

80
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,120
 step.

81
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:03,480
 We just apply the identity

82
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:04,629
 matrix on the left.

83
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:06,580
 Then in the next step, we

84
00:02:06,589 --> 00:02:08,130
 multiply one of the two

85
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,839
 matrices to the right, which

86
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,289
 means we exchange the two

87
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:11,940
 rows here.

88
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,449
 Afterwards, we have our pivot

89
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,649
 at the correct position.

90
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,800
 This means that we now can

91
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:19,539
 put the L matrix into the

92
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:19,940
 game.

93
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,470
 It should be a four times

94
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,300
 four matrix.

95
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,130
 So we start as usual with

96
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:25,220
 the identity matrix.

97
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,110
 And now we have to do the

98
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:28,649
 Gaussian elimination in the

99
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,529
 first column.

100
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:31,710
 So we want to generate zeros

101
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,419
 below the pivot which means

102
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:34,970
 that we are already finished

103
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:35,410
 here.

104
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:37,699
 In other words, second row

105
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,559
 minus zero (times) the first

106
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,490
 row. And the zero

107
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,410
 then goes into the L matrix.

108
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,210
 So this was easy.

109
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,910
 So let's go to the next number

110
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:47,919
 which is two.

111
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,160
 So third row minus

112
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,000
 two times the first row

113
00:02:52,529 --> 00:02:54,270
 and the multiple we subtract

114
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:56,139
 is the number that goes into

115
00:02:56,149 --> 00:02:57,130
 the L matrix.

116
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,850
 Also not so hard.

117
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,289
 The only number that changes

118
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,649
 is the five that gets to

119
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,210
 a three.

120
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,850
 And the last number in the

121
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,149
 column is the one.

122
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,949
 So we subtract one.

123
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:08,639
 And as before, this is the

124
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:10,110
 number that goes into the

125
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:10,910
 L matrix.

126
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,380
 And with that, we are finished

127
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:15,339
 with the first Gaussian elimination.

128
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,100
 Then in the next step, we

129
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,490
 go to the next column and

130
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,729
 choose the next pivot.

131
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,449
 And we see it's nonzero.

132
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,860
 So we don't need any row

133
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,869
 exchanges here.

134
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:25,660
 Otherwise we do the same

135
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:27,110
 as before we generate

136
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:28,679
 zeros below the pivot.

137
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,550
 In the first step, we just

138
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:31,809
 have to subtract one.

139
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,300
 And as before this one goes

140
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:36,279
 immediately to our L matrix.

141
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,000
 On the other side, we get

142
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,690
 a lot of zeros and one

143
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:40,039
 here.

144
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,869
 And then in the next step,

145
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,410
 we have to subtract two times

146
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:44,240
 the second row.

147
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,070
 This too then goes as

148
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,050
 always into the L matrix.

149
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,789
 And with that calculation,

150
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,869
 we are finished with the

151
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,500
 second column, let's go to

152
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:53,270
 the third column.

153
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:54,389
 OK.

154
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,100
 So this is not a pivot,

155
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,949
 but this is also not a pivot.

156
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,639
 So there are no pivots in

157
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:00,550
 the third column.

158
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:02,690
 This means that this column

159
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:04,279
 is finished, we have to go

160
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:05,220
 to the next column.

161
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,580
 However, there we also find

162
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:09,460
 a zero which is not a pivot,

163
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,199
 but there is another pivot

164
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:11,800
 below.

165
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:14,029
 And with that, we know what

166
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,470
 to do, we have to do a row

167
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,190
 exchange.

168
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,358
 In order to do that, we will

169
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:19,890
 insert the identity matrix

170
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:20,298
 again.

171
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,869
 So this is again a permutation

172
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,559
 matrix squared where we have

173
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,200
 now the permutation matrix,

174
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:27,920
 third row to

175
00:04:27,929 --> 00:04:29,589
 fourth row, of

176
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,880
 course, one of them, we can

177
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,119
 apply to the right hand side

178
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,040
 again to get our row exchange.

179
00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:35,760
 Indeed, there we get what

180
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:36,250
 we want.

181
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,720
 Now we have to pivot at the

182
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,600
 correct position.

183
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,839
 However, the permutation

184
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,230
 matrix is not at the correct

185
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,130
 position yet.

186
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,399
 We need that on the left

187
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,019
 hand side.

188
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,390
 Therefore, in the next step,

189
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,859
 we will also add the identity

190
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:50,589
 matrix on the left hand side.

191
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:52,679
 So here again, we have the

192
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,320
 permutation matrix squared.

193
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:56,709
 Now, you know, when we apply

194
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,369
 this matrix to the right,

195
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,929
 we will exchange these two

196
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,660
 rows here.

197
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:02,679
 However, if we apply this

198
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,480
 matrix to the left, we will

199
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:05,799
 exchange the corresponding

200
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:06,459
 columns.

201
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,140
 Nevertheless, this is exactly

202
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:10,790
 what we do in the next step.

203
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,470
 First exchanging the

204
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,029
 rows looks like this.

205
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,589
 And afterwards, we exchanged

206
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,450
 the columns which

207
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:19,850
 results in this

208
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:20,609
 matrix.

209
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,690
 The good thing is you see

210
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,170
 we get again a lower

211
00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:25,399
 triangular matrix

212
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,709
 but don't oversee that this

213
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,160
 really changes the matrix

214
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,170
 L from before.

215
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:31,529
 The good thing is you can

216
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,059
 remember the whole operation

217
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,269
 by just doing the row

218
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,070
 exchange in the blue part

219
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:36,420
 here.

220
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:38,329
 However, of course, now you

221
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,500
 have seen where it really

222
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,179
 comes from.

223
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,299
 OK.

224
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:42,779
 Now that everything is in

225
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,670
 the right order, we can continue

226
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:45,540
 our procedure.

227
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,510
 This means that we want to

228
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,269
 generate a zero here, but

229
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,510
 it's already there, which

230
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,790
 means that we are finished

231
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:53,640
 with this column in the

232
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:55,000
 next column, we then find

233
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,660
 the pivot which is here,

234
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:58,079
 but we don't have to generate

235
00:05:58,089 --> 00:05:59,070
 zeros anymore.

236
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,320
 Indeed, this was our last

237
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:02,859
 step in the whole calculation.

238
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,559
 We have found the row echelon

239
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,760
 form here on the right hand

240
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:06,160
 side.

241
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:07,320
 OK.

242
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:08,739
 So there we have our matrix

243
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:09,410
 U.

244
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:12,119
 And this is our matrix

245
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,109
 L and the

246
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:15,279
 last part is what we still

247
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,299
 can multiply.

248
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,970
 But then we get our matrix

249
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,429
 P.

250
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:20,489
 We've reached our goal.

251
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,450
 Our matrix A from the beginning

252
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:24,320
 is given as P times

253
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:26,290
 L times U and

254
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:27,750
 therefore we call this the

255
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,279
 PLU decomposition.

256
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:30,429
 OK?

257
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,489
 I think that's good enough

258
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,720
 for this example.

259
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:34,279
 I hope you can now apply

260
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,880
 the whole procedure to another

261
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,790
 matrix A and with

262
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:39,329
 that, thanks for listening

263
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:40,470
 and see you next time.

264
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,089
 Bye.
