00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,990
Hello and welcome! First I want to thank all the 
nice people that support this channel on Steady (tbsom.de/s/support)!  

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:15,090
Today I want to show you the LU decomposition 
for a square matrix. This means that we rewrite

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:21,960
our matrix as a product of two matrices, where on 
the one side we have a lower triangular matrix L  

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,610
and on the other side we have an upper triangular 
matrix U. Now in this video I want to show you the  

5
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:38,100
algorithm with the help of one example. I choose 
a  4x4-matrix and I call it A. Here you  

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,340
see this looks like a nice example. However it's 
not a trivial one. Now I can immediately tell you  

7
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,780
that doing the LU decomposition is basically just 
an expanded Gaussian elimination. Therefore please  

8
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,930
remember you can do the Gaussian elimination 
by just using row operations. And what you get  

9
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:06,030
out is an upper triangular matrix in the end and 
this is exactly the U in our LU decomposition.

10
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,840
At this point I can give you a warning: we will not 
use row exchanges in this example here. Indeed  

11
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,200
it's essential for the LU decomposition that 
you don't use row exchanges while applying the  

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,920
algorithm. This means that if you have a matrix 
where you really need row exchanges in the  

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,730
Gaussian elimination, then you should apply these 
all beforehand and then just use the algorithm

14
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:40,470
I now show you. Okay, then I would say we start with 
our nice example here. The first step is always  

15
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:50,130
to include an identity matrix with the right size.
Here it would be 4x4-matrix, so I use 1, 1,

16
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:59,040
1, 1 on the diagonal and the rest are zeros. And 
on the right hand side I just copy my matrix from  

17
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,310
before. Obviously, the equality still holds because 
we just multiply with the identity matrix.

18
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:13,740
And now we see: we almost have our LU decomposition here. 
We will transform the identity matrix into a  

19
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:21,330
lower triangular matrix, so we will fill in numbers 
here but not here, and we will transform this one  

20
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:28,320
to an upper triangular matrix.
This means that we now just use the normal Gaussian elimination on  

21
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:36,240
the right, but now we also memorize all the steps 
with the help of the matrix on the left.

22
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,570
Okay, you will see a immediately how this works with the first step. 
Okay so I copied the first row because we  

23
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:48,840
won't change it but we will change all the other 
rows.
Now in the first Gaussian elimination step we  

24
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:57,420
use this number as a pivot and we want to generate zeros below it.
Therefore to get a 0 here in the  

25
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:04,200
second row we have to use two times the first row. 
Hence we can write this as: use the second  

26
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:15,030
row minus (-2) times the first row.
Of course, we could rewrite this as plus 2 times the first  

27
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:22,020
row but for the LU decomposition is always helpful  to use a minus sign here.
This means that we always  

28
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:30,270
subtract multiples of another row.
This is very helpful because this number here we subtract is  

29
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:38,340
the number we will put in the matrix L.
Where to put it is very easy because here we generated a 0.

30
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:46,020
And at the exact same position we put the 
new number in the matrix L. And in the same way,

31
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:52,680
it works for all other positions here.
Now with the matrix multiplication you see that this is  

32
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,640
indeed the correct sign we chose because if you 
multiply 2 with (-2) here you get out  

33
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:06,840
indeed -4 as we want.
However still we have to do our calculation here so we do our  

34
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:14,100
Gaussian elimination step which means we have the 0 here as wanted; here we have 1; here we have

35
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:21,720
also 1; and there we have 2.
OK, now we can do 
the same thing for the third row which means we  

36
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,960
take the third row and we have to subtract a 
multiple of the first row, which is here just

37
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:35,910
3 times the first row.
OK, now you know the 
multiple we subtract, so 3 is the number we  

38
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:41,400
put at the right position here. And of course 
we also have to do the calculation which is 0  

39
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:52,140
here, minus 4, minus 7, and minus 6 here.
Again we can 
check that our sign was correct: so if you multiply  

40
00:04:52,140 --> 00:05:00,420
this column with this row, we get out 2 times 3, 
so our 6. And finally we can do the whole thing  

41
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:07,170
for the last row. So I take the fourth row and I 
look at the multiple of the row I have  

42
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:14,520
to subtract. And here it is 2 times the first row.
And now you already know we have to put this  

43
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:22,080
2 into our matrix L. And also the calculation 
in last row is not so hard: we have the 0 here,

44
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:31,350
here we have 8, so 1 remains, and here we have 
minus 8, and there 4.
Well now we are finished  

45
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:37,740
with our first column because everything is 0 here.
Now we go to our next column, so the second  

46
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,800
column, which means this is our new pivot.
So the procedure would be exactly the same, we now just  

47
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,970
produce the zeros here. 
OK, in order to do this,
let's start a new line. So let's copy everything  

48
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:57,360
and then do the same Gaussian elimination as 
before. We can copy the first two rows because  

49
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,470
we won't change them anymore. The first step is 
of course to generate a 0 here, which means that  

50
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:12,360
we take the third row and use the second row to 
change it. Now you see we have to add 4 times the  

51
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:21,000
second row to get a 0 here; and therefore we write 
it as subtracting minus 4 times the second row.

52
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:30,450
And now this multiple is the number we put here at the right position: minus 4.
And our calculation  

53
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:40,050
in the third row gives us here 0, 0.
Here we have 4 and minus 7 so minus 3, and here we have 2.

54
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:47,160
So let's to the next step which means generate 
a zero here. So take the fourth row and subtract  

55
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:55,980
the second row, so minus 1 times the second row.
And again this one is the thing we put here in our  

56
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:03,750
matrix L. And the last calculation here is very 
easy: we just have 0, 0, -9, and 2.

57
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:11,370
Okay very good, so now you see we just need one 
last step in our Gaussian elimination. So let's  

58
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:17,850
do that very quickly now. Well, I copied everything 
again except the last row because this is the only  

59
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:23,490
one we change now. And you immediately see what 
we need we just have to change the 4th row  

60
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:31,410
by subtracting 3 times the third row. And 
as before the number we subtract is the number  

61
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:39,450
we put in here. Then we just have to zeros here and (-4) here.
And there you have it that's our  

62
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:47,070
LU decomposition. On the left we have our lower 
triangular matrix, which we call L, and we want  

63
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:53,010
to choose it with only 1s on the diagonal. And 
you see that is exactly what we get out with this  

64
00:07:53,010 --> 00:08:00,090
algorithm. And on the right hand side you see this 
is our upper triangular matrix U. There on the  

65
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:07,140
diagonal everything can happen. Now please recall that you get U by just using Gaussian elimination  

66
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:15,420
and L by saving all these steps in the Gaussian 
elimination. Therefore the matrix multiplication  

67
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:23,520
here gives us, in fact, our original matrix back.
However just in the case that we don't need to  

68
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:30,990
use row exchanges in the Gaussian elimination. How to deal with this and how to generalize the whole  

69
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:37,890
concept here, I can show you in another video.
For now, I hope this example really helped you such  

70
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:45,270
that you now can calculate an LU decomposition 
of a matrix. And then: see you next time! Bye!
