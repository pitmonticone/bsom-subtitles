00:00:00,419 --> 00:00:02,400
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,239
 abstract linear algebra,

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,579
 the video series where we

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,539
 talk a lot about some advanced

5
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,239
 topics in linear algebra.

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,479
 And now in today's part nine,

7
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:13,130
 I want to talk more about

8
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,680
 the so-called change of

9
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:15,340
 basis.

10
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:17,030
 More concretely, we will

11
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,760
 look at a common example.

12
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,940
 However, as always before

13
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,360
 we start, I really want to

14
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,760
 thank all the nice people

15
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,770
 who support this channel

16
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,340
 on Steady, here on youtube

17
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,549
 or via Patreon.

18
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,920
 And moreover, as a reward,

19
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,370
 you find a lot of additional

20
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:33,200
 material for all the videos

21
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:34,880
 with the link in the description.

22
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,799
 So if you're interested in

23
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,560
 learning mathematics, please

24
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:39,319
 have a look.

25
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,189
 OK, then let's immediately

26
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,599
 start with the topic of today

27
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,220
 by recalling the so

28
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:45,659
 called change of basis

29
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:46,340
 matrix.

30
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,290
 We also know it has some

31
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,020
 other names like transformation

32
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:51,340
 matrix or transition

33
00:00:51,349 --> 00:00:52,099
 matrix.

34
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,959
 However, the important fact

35
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,830
 is it's a square matrix

36
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,790
 that transforms vectors given

37
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,479
 in the basis C into

38
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,220
 vectors given in the basis

39
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:01,700
 B.

40
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:03,869
 Hence a column vector that

41
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,480
 comes in here from the right

42
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,769
 hand side should be

43
00:01:06,779 --> 00:01:08,529
 interpreted as a vector

44
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,150
 represented with respect

45
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,300
 to the basis C.

46
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:12,889
 And then the column vector

47
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,120
 that comes out is

48
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:15,809
 represented with respect

49
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:16,800
 to the basis B.

50
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,940
 So please recall they are

51
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:20,879
 just the images with respect

52
00:01:20,889 --> 00:01:22,839
 to the basis isomorphisms.

53
00:01:23,339 --> 00:01:24,720
 So usually we say they

54
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,339
 represent the same vector

55
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:27,870
 V in our abstract vector

56
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,529
 space.

57
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,199
 However, with respect to

58
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:31,959
 different chosen bases.

59
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:34,529
 So now we know if the abstract

60
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,250
 vector space V has dimension

61
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,129
 N, then this change of base

62
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,129
 matrix is an N times N

63
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:40,849
 matrix.

64
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,000
 Moreover, we also know

65
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,849
 it's an invertible matrix.

66
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,089
 Of course, this makes sense

67
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:48,730
 because we should be able

68
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:50,290
 to translate back again.

69
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:51,510
 OK.

70
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,010
 And now in this video, we

71
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:54,419
 will look at a very concrete

72
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,300
 example for such a change

73
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:57,559
 of basis matrix.

74
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,699
 Indeed, it's a very common

75
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:01,389
 one and you can always use

76
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,889
 it if you want to change

77
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,540
 the basis in RN.

78
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:06,849
 This means in our picture

79
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,258
 here, the abstract vector

80
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,130
 space V is now given

81
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,210
 by R two.

82
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,580
 And at this point, you might

83
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:15,509
 argue it's not needed to

84
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,979
 have this abstract picture

85
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,979
 here because the vector space

86
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,690
 is already given by the

87
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:22,600
 very concrete one R two.

88
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,770
 However, the basis

89
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:26,619
 isomorphism are still

90
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,490
 helpful to understand what

91
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,410
 is happening here.

92
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:31,720
 This means if we have two

93
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:33,389
 bases given we can

94
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:35,320
 still translate them to R

95
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:35,929
 two again.

96
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,559
 Hence we land in R two

97
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,130
 again.

98
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:40,800
 But now with the canonical

99
00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:42,490
 basis and as

100
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,050
 always the corresponding

101
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:46,000
 basis isomorphisms are

102
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:47,919
 denoted by Phi B and

103
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:49,479
 Phi C respectively.

104
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:50,539
 OK.

105
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,800
 Now let's look at a very

106
00:02:51,809 --> 00:02:53,679
 concrete example, let's say

107
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,070
 B is given by two

108
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,699
 vectors namely

109
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,029
 1 2 and

110
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,000
 3 4.

111
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:00,949
 And on the other hand, we

112
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,720
 also define C by

113
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:03,839
 two vectors.

114
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,720
 And here we choose

115
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:07,660
 1 0 2 2.

116
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,259
 The first thing you should

117
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,710
 note is that both are

118
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,500
 bases in R two.

119
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,850
 And maybe you chose spaces

120
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,809
 B because it's helpful to

121
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,490
 solve a particular problem,

122
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,119
 but then you have to solve

123
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,289
 another problem.

124
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:22,770
 And then it turns out that

125
00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:23,990
 the basis C is

126
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,800
 beneficial.

127
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,929
 Therefore, the only thing

128
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,520
 you need is the change of

129
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:29,990
 basis matrix here.

130
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,130
 On the lower level

131
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:33,619
 with this matrix T, you can

132
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,619
 do all the translations between

133
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,500
 both sides.

134
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,759
 However, now, in order to

135
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,699
 calculate this matrix, it's

136
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,270
 helpful to introduce a

137
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:44,050
 third basis as well.

138
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:46,380
 The reason for this is that

139
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:48,259
 we already have a very nice

140
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,619
 basis in R two,

141
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:52,229
 namely we have the canonical

142
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,580
 basis, the standard

143
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:54,339
 basis.

144
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:56,160
 And I will denote this with

145
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,130
 a curved E

146
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,789
 now as a reminder E is

147
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,679
 just given by

148
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,669
 1 0 0 1.

149
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,240
 So you know, this is exactly

150
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,160
 the basis we want to have

151
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:08,589
 here on the lower level.

152
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,919
 Therefore, our basis

153
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:12,830
 isomorphism in this case

154
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:14,389
 does not change anything.

155
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,950
 So Phi E is simply

156
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,670
 given by the identity map.

157
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,890
 And exactly this fact

158
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,790
 implies that we have two

159
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:24,750
 very simple transformation

160
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,850
 matrices here.

161
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,149
 And please note the first

162
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,790
 one here sends B to

163
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:31,359
 E and the second one

164
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:33,000
 here sends E to

165
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:33,440
 C.

166
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:35,950
 And in addition, the composition

167
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,890
 of both matrices is

168
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,890
 exactly our TCB

169
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,309
 and exactly with this matrix

170
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,640
 product, we want to

171
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:45,410
 calculate this transformation

172
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,019
 matrix.

173
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,410
 OK.

174
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,040
 Then I would say let's write

175
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:50,730
 down what we already

176
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:52,489
 know, namely,

177
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,130
 we already know the

178
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,040
 matrix T EB

179
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,130
 because it reads that the

180
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,920
 basis B is to be

181
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:01,570
 expressed in the standard

182
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:02,209
 basis.

183
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,390
 Indeed, if you look at the

184
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,279
 basis B, you see the

185
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,000
 vectors are already given

186
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,660
 with respect to our standard

187
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,630
 basis more precisely.

188
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,619
 And by definition T E B

189
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,359
 is given by Phi

190
00:05:15,369 --> 00:05:17,049
 E of b1

191
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:19,049
 in the first column and

192
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:21,019
 Phi E of b two in

193
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,070
 the second column.

194
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:24,290
 However, please don't forget

195
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:25,809
 Phi E is just the

196
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,769
 identity map.

197
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,709
 In other words, we have a

198
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,279
 matrix here with b

199
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,829
 one and b two in the

200
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,470
 columns.

201
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,559
 Hence, we can just take the

202
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,350
 basis vectors as column

203
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:38,260
 vectors and put them into

204
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:39,739
 a two times two matrix.

205
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,769
 So for our example here,

206
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:42,989
 it means we have

207
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,119
 1 2 3 4.

208
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,730
 In other words, by writing

209
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:49,570
 down the basis B like this,

210
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:51,440
 we already know we have

211
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,420
 this change of basis matrix.

212
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,929
 And in the same way, we

213
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,799
 also have this for the basis

214
00:05:57,809 --> 00:05:59,559
 C represented in the

215
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,040
 canonical basis as well.

216
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,570
 So this is exactly the inverse

217
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:05,130
 of the matrix we actually

218
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,170
 need in the end.

219
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,260
 However, this is also

220
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,940
 something we should already

221
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,820
 write down.

222
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,320
 So let's write down T E C

223
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,459
 and now with the basis vectors

224
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,429
 of C, which

225
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,910
 as you might recall were

226
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,709
 given as

227
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,859
 1 0 2 2.

228
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,070
 OK.

229
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,630
 And with that, you see, we

230
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,010
 have all the information

231
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,540
 we need to actually

232
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:29,329
 calculate the matrix we

233
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:29,790
 want.

234
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,799
 And now I want to show you

235
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,600
 the most efficient way to

236
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:34,140
 do it.

237
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:36,179
 Indeed, it's simply a

238
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,820
 composition where we have

239
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:39,630
 one inverse involved.

240
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,470
 However, first you should

241
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,339
 see that the change of basis

242
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,220
 matrices nicely fit

243
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,970
 together with their indices.

244
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,630
 For example, here, if B

245
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,200
 goes in from the right hand

246
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:52,929
 side, it also has to

247
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,679
 go in from the right here

248
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,880
 on the other side.

249
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:58,519
 And moreover, if the basis

250
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:00,390
 C comes out on the left

251
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,350
 here, it also has to come

252
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,200
 out here.

253
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,459
 So whenever you want to put

254
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,019
 in a third matrix in the

255
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,850
 middle, you just have a matrix

256
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:10,739
 product where E is

257
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,339
 also in the middle here.

258
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,450
 However, now for our

259
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:16,200
 calculation, we see that

260
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:18,100
 this matrix here is the

261
00:07:18,109 --> 00:07:20,070
 inverse of a matrix we already

262
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:20,470
 know.

263
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,809
 Hence, we just have to calculate

264
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,190
 the inverse here and

265
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,790
 multiply the result

266
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:27,070
 with this matrix

267
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:27,829
 T E B.

268
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,359
 Now, of course, in this particular

269
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:31,929
 example here, it's no

270
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,799
 problem at all to calculate

271
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:35,410
 the inverse of this two times

272
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,200
 two matrix.

273
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,079
 However, in higher

274
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:40,010
 dimensions, an inverse can

275
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:41,529
 make a lot of problems

276
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,429
 because calculating it is

277
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,309
 a lot of work.

278
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,700
 And actually, we don't need

279
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,519
 to know the inverse because

280
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:50,190
 we just need to know this

281
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,059
 product here.

282
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:53,209
 Therefore, the efficient

283
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,959
 way is to calculate this

284
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,529
 product in one go.

285
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,609
 Indeed you might already

286
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:00,309
 know how to do that because

287
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,279
 it's just a Gaussian elimination.

288
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:04,170
 However, for the sake of

289
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:06,070
 completeness, I want to show

290
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,250
 you how to do it.

291
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,420
 Now, the first thing you

292
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:10,709
 should note here is that

293
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,109
 in order to calculate this

294
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:14,010
 product, we need to solve

295
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:14,670
 an equation.

296
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,940
 In fact, the solution of

297
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,619
 this matrix equation should

298
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,850
 be exactly this

299
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:21,459
 transformation matrix here.

300
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:23,450
 And maybe let's call this

301
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:23,910
 solution.

302
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,730
 We want simply X.

303
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,850
 And now if we bring this

304
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:29,410
 matrix here to the left hand

305
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,130
 side, we simply have

306
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,859
 T E C times X

307
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:33,929
 is equal to

308
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,599
 T E B so

309
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:37,130
 exactly this is the

310
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,880
 matrix equation we want to

311
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,429
 solve.

312
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,169
 And now the important thing

313
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,690
 to note is that this is

314
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,369
 simply a system of

315
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,770
 linear equations.

316
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:47,630
 More precisely these are

317
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,530
 more systems packed together

318
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:51,280
 because we have more right

319
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,130
 hand sides.

320
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,520
 In this case here, you see

321
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,179
 we have exactly two

322
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,729
 right-hand sides because

323
00:08:57,739 --> 00:08:59,390
 we have two column vectors.

324
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:01,619
 But we can simply do the

325
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,460
 Gaussian elimination for

326
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:04,849
 all right hand sides

327
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:06,010
 simultaneously.

328
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,359
 And indeed, this immediately

329
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:09,969
 saves a lot of work.

330
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:11,119
 OK.

331
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,380
 Now let's write down what

332
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,380
 we have to solve.

333
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:13,869
 We have

334
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,820
 1 0 2 2 on the

335
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,750
 left hand side and

336
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,469
 1 2 3 4

337
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:20,989
 on the right hand side.

338
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,179
 OK.

339
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,679
 And now we can do the Gaussian

340
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,549
 elimination as always, which

341
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,940
 means we bring the left hand

342
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,469
 side into a row echelon

343
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:29,049
 form.

344
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,530
 But then we can also do the

345
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:31,909
 backward substitution.

346
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:34,159
 And indeed, in this example,

347
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:35,919
 we already have the row echelon

348
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:36,460
 form.

349
00:09:36,469 --> 00:09:37,950
 So we just need to do the

350
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,400
 backward substitution.

351
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,650
 However, we want to do this

352
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:43,289
 inside this matrix

353
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:44,960
 notation, which

354
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:46,630
 essentially means in order

355
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,419
 to solve this system here,

356
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:50,000
 we need to generate an

357
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,909
 identity matrix on the left

358
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,609
 hand side because

359
00:09:53,619 --> 00:09:55,559
 then the components of the

360
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,349
 solution X can be read

361
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:58,719
 on the right hand side.

362
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,380
 In fact, this is what produces

363
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,330
 a nice algorithm for us.

364
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,469
 OK.

365
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,820
 Here, our first step should

366
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,559
 be that we multiply the

367
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,099
 second row by one

368
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,039
 half because then

369
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:13,030
 we already have the one here

370
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,520
 in the right lower corner.

371
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,500
 And then in the next step,

372
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,140
 we want to generate a zero

373
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,609
 here.

374
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,229
 Hence, from the first row,

375
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:23,000
 we subtract two times the

376
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,190
 new second row.

377
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,340
 And then we have it, we have

378
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:27,989
 the identity matrix here

379
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,330
 on the left hand side

380
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,419
 and on the right hand side,

381
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,119
 we find minus one minus

382
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,099
 one here and there

383
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:36,429
 we have it, the system is

384
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,719
 completely solved.

385
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:38,900
 And with this backward

386
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:40,609
 substitution in this matrix

387
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:42,460
 notation, we find all the

388
00:10:42,469 --> 00:10:43,840
 components of the solution

389
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:44,260
 here.

390
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,340
 And you see, as we've

391
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:47,989
 expected, we find a

392
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,250
 unique solution

393
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,669
 and this solution X is

394
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,390
 exactly our change of

395
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,590
 basis matrix.

396
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,770
 So it's exactly TCB

397
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:58,710
 and this answers our question

398
00:10:58,719 --> 00:10:59,590
 from the beginning.

399
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:02,059
 So with this matrix now

400
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,539
 we can do the translation

401
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:05,000
 from the matrix (basis) B

402
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:06,609
 into the matrix (basis) C.

403
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:08,650
 Moreover, you should see

404
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:10,210
 this whole procedure I've

405
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:11,369
 demonstrated here.

406
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,690
 Would also work.

407
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,570
 For example, for R five,

408
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:16,820
 the only thing that changes

409
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,859
 is that you have a little

410
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:19,659
 bit more work in solving

411
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:20,599
 this system here.

412
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,919
 However, the whole idea is

413
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:24,150
 exactly the same.

414
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,929
 So now you can apply it to

415
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,400
 all other examples.

416
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:28,760
 OK.

417
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,049
 So now you know how to

418
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:32,020
 calculate a change of basis

419
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,679
 matrix.

420
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,080
 So with the next video, we

421
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,799
 will go more abstract again.

422
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,239
 Therefore, I really hope

423
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,390
 we meet again and have a

424
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,070
 nice day.

425
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:40,869
 Bye bye.
