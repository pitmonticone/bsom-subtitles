00:00:00,386 --> 00:00:04,224
Hello and welcome to abstract linear algebra.

2
00:00:04,314 --> 00:00:07,972
The video course that extends my other linear algebra course.

3
00:00:08,514 --> 00:00:16,307
and before we start, as always I want to give a big thank you to all supporters on Steady, here on YouTube or on Patreon.

4
00:00:16,507 --> 00:00:21,280
You make it possible that I can create such videos about mathematics

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,660
and there you should know as a supporter, you can download PDF versions and quizzes for all the videos.

6
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:34,436
Ok, then let's immediately start with this new series by telling you about the prerequisites you need.

7
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:41,144
As always my "start learning mathematics" course gives you a good foundation for all my other courses.

8
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:47,736
This is what you need, when you want to know how to work with sets and how to construct the numbers sets

9
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:54,901
and based on that knowledge you can immediately go to my "linear algebra" course or to my "real analysis" course

10
00:00:55,101 --> 00:01:03,185
and know it might not surprise you that watching my "linear algebra" course really helps understanding this "abstract linear algebra" course.

11
00:01:03,657 --> 00:01:11,467
However you don't need the full knowledge of this concrete linear algebra course to understand our new abstract linear algebra course,

12
00:01:11,857 --> 00:01:19,809
but you need the core concepts from calculating in R^n and C^n to get the idea how to generalize these.

13
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:28,671
Moreover it also helps to have some knowledge of real analysis such that you can understand some abstract examples here.

14
00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:36,067
Ok, after this I think I can give you a short overview of what to expect in this video series here.

15
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:42,840
In some sense you can say, we will generalize everything we already know from R^n and C^n.

16
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,342
This means from now on we will work in general or abstract vector spaces

17
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:54,552
and then R^n or C^n are just some special examples for vector spaces.

18
00:01:54,752 --> 00:01:59,510
Moreover in the same sense we can also generalize matrices.

19
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:07,865
So you should already know, matrices are related to linear maps and here we will define abstract, general linear maps.

20
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:16,104
Therefore one important topic here is if we can still use matrices to calculate with such linear maps

21
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:21,112
and related to this is an important concept we call change of basis.

22
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:29,734
Indeed, we can define the notion basis for an abstract vector space and then the question is: "what happens when we change it?"

23
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:37,624
In fact we already discussed it a little bit in the old course, but now we can discuss it in all generality.

24
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:43,379
Also on an abstract level we will talk about angles and lengths

25
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:49,720
and there you might already know, in order to do that we need the concept of a general inner product.

26
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:57,458
There we will see that with an inner product we have much more geometry in such an abstract vector space.

27
00:02:57,658 --> 00:03:04,294
In fact we need the inner product such that we can say that 2 objects are orthogonal to each other

28
00:03:04,494 --> 00:03:09,106
and we will see that we have a lot of important applications for that.

29
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:14,637
Ok and now the last topic I want to drop here is the one about eigenvalues.

30
00:03:14,957 --> 00:03:22,717
There you might already know eigenvalues for matrices and now we can translate this to general linear maps.

31
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:31,335
Ok, so in summary we can say, what we will do is that we generalize all the notions we already know from the concrete level.

32
00:03:31,414 --> 00:03:39,737
Moreover I would say after doing that, you will see why linear algebra is such a powerful tool in all parts of mathematics

33
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:45,248
and then I would say let's start with the first definition of this course

34
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:50,067
and this is not so surprising. This will be the definition of a vector space

35
00:03:50,543 --> 00:03:58,558
and in order to understand this definition, just imagine what we already know from the vector spaces R^n and C^n.

36
00:03:58,758 --> 00:04:03,023
In fact these are vector spaces, because of 2 operations.

37
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:06,317
First we know that we can add 2 vectors

38
00:04:06,517 --> 00:04:11,939
and as always we can visualize this operation by putting the arrows together

39
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:17,166
and moreover the second operation is that we can scale a vector

40
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:22,279
and with that we have exactly what we want. We want to calculate with vectors.

41
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,959
Namely we want to add them and we want to scale them.

42
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:30,033
So we need vector addition and scalar multiplication

43
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:36,431
and here please don't forget for the second operation here, we need scalars as scaling factors

44
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:41,406
and in fact they always have to come from a so called field

45
00:04:41,606 --> 00:04:49,723
and of course for R^n or C^n this is not so complicated, because they come either from the real number line or from the complex plane

46
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:57,438
and there you should know both are fields, so you can calculate in them with the normal calculation rules for numbers.

47
00:04:57,638 --> 00:05:01,757
In particular you know how to add numbers. You can multiply them.

48
00:05:01,814 --> 00:05:07,785
We have a neutral element with respect to the addition and another one with respect to the multiplication and so on

49
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:13,177
and more details about that, you find in my "start learning numbers" series.

50
00:05:13,543 --> 00:05:20,540
The important fact here is just that we need ordinary numbers, for the scaling factors in our vector space.

51
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:27,415
Ok, but now we just want to put these 2 operations in the definition of a vector space.

52
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:36,484
In other words we will take a set V such that we can calculate with the elements in it as we calculate in R^n or C^n.

53
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:41,778
Therefore the first thing we want to fix here is a field F.

54
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:48,952
This now could be any field, but often it's either the real number line or the complex plane again.

55
00:05:49,152 --> 00:05:53,665
Of course the choice of the field definitely depends on which problem you want to takle,

56
00:05:53,865 --> 00:05:57,485
but for the moment it's enough to think of R or C.

57
00:05:57,914 --> 00:06:03,207
However now the vector space V can be any set that is not the empty set.

58
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,666
This is what you should immediately remember. A vector space can never be empty.

59
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:15,463
Ok and now by what we have said before, we know that we need exactly 2 operations for this set.

60
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,757
This simply means that we have 2 maps in the definition.

61
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:25,134
The first one is the vector addition we usually denote with a plus sign.

62
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:29,093
However, please don't forget, this is now an abstract plus sign.

63
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:34,269
So definitely operation than the addition in R or C.

64
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:40,451
So now we know, the vector addition needs 2 inputs. Namely 2 vectors from V

65
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:44,774
and then the output should be again a vector in V.

66
00:06:45,186 --> 00:06:49,610
So not so fancy. 2 vectors together gives us a new vector.

67
00:06:49,957 --> 00:06:54,568
Moreover on the other hand we also have the scalar multiplication

68
00:06:55,086 --> 00:06:59,107
and maybe not so surprising this one we will denote with a dot.

69
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:03,515
However again here it's an abstract multiplication sign.

70
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:10,362
So here again we have 2 inputs, but the first one is now the field.

71
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:15,336
Namely we put in one scalar and one vector from V

72
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:20,211
and not so surprising, what should come out is a vector in V again.

73
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:27,024
Now you should see, we immediately know examples for these operations when you look at R^n or C^n.

74
00:07:27,224 --> 00:07:33,640
However from these examples we know that the 2 operations also fulfill some rules.

75
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,225
Indeed, if we put them together, we see we need exactly 8 rules.

76
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:45,336
In other words, if these rules are satisfied, we can call V a vector space.

77
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:49,494
More precisely we will call it a F vector space.

78
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:56,147
So here please don't forget, the corresponding field for the scalars is included in the definition.

79
00:07:56,347 --> 00:08:03,080
So for example if the corresponding field is given by the real numbers, you would say we have a real vector space

80
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:10,311
and as I said before at least in this course real and complex vector spaces are the most important ones.

81
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:16,735
Ok, but now as you might expect it is time to list the 8 rules we need.

82
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:26,553
Indeed, the first 4 we can already put together, by just saying that V together with the vector addition is a so called abelian group.

83
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:33,644
This means we have the 3 group axioms and in addition the operation is also commutative.

84
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:38,741
More precisely the first property of the group is associativity.

85
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:46,080
This means if we take elements u, v, w from V, we can exchange the parentheses like that.

86
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:53,865
Ok, moreover you might also know the second rule is that we have a neutral element with respect to the addition.

87
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:58,977
Of course this is then what we call the 0 vector in our abstract vector space

88
00:08:59,177 --> 00:09:04,891
and then with respect to this neutral element we also find inverse elements.

89
00:09:05,571 --> 00:09:14,109
More precisely it means that for each lower case v in our vector space V, we find another vector we call -v

90
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:17,425
such that the addition gives us the 0 vector.

91
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:24,242
So the requirement here is that all the inverses with respect to addition also lie in our set V.

92
00:09:24,943 --> 00:09:30,718
Ok and then the last rule I already told you about. It simply means that the addition is commutative.

93
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:35,717
Hence it does not matter in which order we add up 2 vectors.

94
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:41,996
Ok, then let's go to the next 2 rules, which concerns the scalar multiplication

95
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:48,028
and we can summarize them by saying that the scalar multiplication is compatible

96
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:52,600
and first that means the scalar multiplication acts nicely

97
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:57,200
when we put it together with the multiplication we already know from our field.

98
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:05,113
So you should see, here on the left-hand side we scale the vector v 2 times, but on the right-hand side we only scale it once.

99
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:09,643
However the claim here is that the result should be the same vector.

100
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,036
Which means you can multiply the scalars beforehand.

101
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:19,491
So it means the scalar multiplication is compatible with the other multiplication

102
00:10:19,691 --> 00:10:22,886
and moreover the second rule here tells us

103
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:29,123
that the multiplicative unit from our field is also compatible with this scalar multiplication.

104
00:10:29,323 --> 00:10:34,667
So if you multiply with the scalar 1, you don't change the vector v at all.

105
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:38,749
Ok and now we exactly need 2 rules more.

106
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:44,149
Also these can be put together as we simply speak of distributive laws

107
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:51,113
and of course they are essential, because they connect the scalar multiplication with the vector addition.

108
00:10:51,313 --> 00:10:59,132
So for example, here it means scaling the result of a vector addition is the same as adding the two scaled vectors

109
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:07,600
and on the other hand if we first add 2 scalars in our field F, it's the same as adding the scaled vectors.

110
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:14,368
So you see, here it's important to note that the two plus signs denote two different operations.

111
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:22,740
However, now we have learned that the rules of the vector space claim that the two different operations act nicely together.

112
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,854
Ok, very nice. Now we have everything.

113
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:29,618
The result that we get here is an abstract vector space

114
00:11:30,186 --> 00:11:38,456
and with these rules now, we can calculate inside this abstract vector space, as we already know it from R^n and C^n.

115
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:45,678
This means the visualization we have with these arrows also works in this abstract sense.

116
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:52,974
This means imagining vectors given as arrows always helps to remember these operations.

117
00:11:53,174 --> 00:11:58,586
However, you should always keep in mind that the elements of a vector space are not arrows.

118
00:11:58,614 --> 00:12:01,057
We only use them for the visualization.

119
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:08,020
Indeed, the elements of a vector space, so called vectors, could be now very abstract objects

120
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:13,919
and I can already promise you, in the next video we will see such nice examples.

121
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:19,229
Therefore I really hope we meet again and have a nice day. Bye bye!
