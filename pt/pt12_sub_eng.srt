00:00:00,409 --> 00:00:02,390
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,019
 probability theory.

3
00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:05,920
 And as you already know,

4
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:07,289
 first, I want to thank all

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,520
 the nice people that support

6
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:09,859
 this channel on study or

7
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:10,479
 paypal.

8
00:00:11,149 --> 00:00:12,649
 Now, in today's part 12,

9
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:14,350
 we will talk about the important

10
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:16,010
 cumulative distribution

11
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:16,489
 function.

12
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,040
 So here you already see this

13
00:00:19,049 --> 00:00:20,659
 is such a long word that

14
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,239
 often one just speaks of

15
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,379
 the CDF

16
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,379
 .

17
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,680
 Now, soon we will see that

18
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,540
 every random variable has

19
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:29,840
 such a CDF.

20
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,040
 For this, please recall

21
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,680
 that a random variable just

22
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:35,250
 translates from an abstract

23
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:37,220
 probability space into a

24
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:39,049
 very concrete one given in

25
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,200
 the real number line.

26
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:42,290
 In particular, this could

27
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:43,689
 be a discrete probability

28
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,529
 space where only some

29
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,319
 values in R are relevant

30
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,430
 for the probability measure

31
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,110
 PX.

32
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:51,419
 In other words, you can easily

33
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,990
 embed a discrete set of

34
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,599
 numbers into R.

35
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:56,889
 This means that if you think

36
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,750
 of both cases we had so the

37
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,590
 discrete one and the absolutely

38
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:02,509
 continuous one both are

39
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,389
 included here.

40
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,989
 This helps because then the

41
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,629
 notion of a CDF is

42
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:09,239
 exactly the same in both

43
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:09,830
 cases.

44
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,129
 Therefore, I would say let's

45
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,830
 define this cumulative

46
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:15,230
 distribution function.

47
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:16,519
 Here.

48
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:18,019
 I can already tell you we

49
00:01:18,029 --> 00:01:19,279
 will always denote it with

50
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,980
 capital F where in the

51
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:22,269
 index we put in the

52
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:23,639
 random variable X.

53
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,120
 And indeed, often we will

54
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,319
 plot the function on the

55
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,959
 whole real number line.

56
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,339
 A typical graph could look

57
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:32,250
 like this.

58
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,169
 So it's always increasing.

59
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,250
 However, it's also

60
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,690
 possible that it stays

61
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:38,440
 constant.

62
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,599
 Therefore, the first warning

63
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,389
 here, you should never confuse

64
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,150
 this with a probability

65
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,290
 density function.

66
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,279
 A PDF.

67
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:47,730
 OK.

68
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:49,169
 I think that was enough talking

69
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:49,529
 here.

70
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:51,239
 Let's go to the definition.

71
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,129
 Now, the assumptions

72
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:54,410
 are the same as in the last

73
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:54,900
 video.

74
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,680
 So we have omega A P as a

75
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,459
 probability space and

76
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,940
 X as a random variable.

77
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,160
 It's not an abstract random

78
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:03,980
 variable but a real valued

79
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:05,949
 one implicitly.

80
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,190
 This means we have the Borel

81
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:08,949
 Sigma algebra for

82
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,490
 R.

83
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:11,949
 Now, in fact, this is all

84
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,399
 we need and now we can

85
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,699
 define the function

86
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,570
 FX.

87
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:17,740
 It's important to remember

88
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,149
 here that the domain for

89
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,889
 F of X is always the

90
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:22,369
 whole real number line

91
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,949
 and the possible values lie

92
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,490
 in the unit interval.

93
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,699
 So what you can keep in mind

94
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,690
 is the co domain of X

95
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:32,850
 is the domain of FX.

96
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,190
 OK.

97
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,550
 Now, as you can see in the

98
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:37,479
 unit interval FX

99
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,429
 is defined as a probability,

100
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:42,169
 namely putting in a lower

101
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:44,070
 case X into the function

102
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,550
 is defined as

103
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:47,679
 the probability of the

104
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,970
 interval minus

105
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:50,919
 infinity to X.

106
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,220
 And it's measured with

107
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:55,220
 PX, the distribution,

108
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:56,860
 the probability distribution

109
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:58,500
 of the random variable X.

110
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:01,110
 And with this, you see that's

111
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,970
 the reason it's called cumulative

112
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:04,300
 distribution function.

113
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,899
 So we include here all possible.

114
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,710
 values until we reach the

115
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,949
 given point X

116
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:12,309
 and here, maybe it's helpful

117
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,050
 as a reminder that this can

118
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:15,399
 be written with the original

119
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,789
 probability measure P.

120
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:19,210
 So we have P of the

121
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,000
 random variable capital X

122
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:22,869
 is less or equal than the

123
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,990
 lower case X.

124
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,300
 And we have learned this

125
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:27,860
 is exactly the same thing

126
00:03:27,869 --> 00:03:28,539
 as this.

127
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:29,929
 OK.

128
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,820
 Then this nice well defined

129
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,610
 function FX is called the

130
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:35,130
 cumulative distribution

131
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:36,589
 function of the random variable 

132
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,119
 capital X.

133
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,690
 Indeed some people simply

134
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:42,399
 call it distribution function

135
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:42,940
 of X.

136
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,210
 Or in short, as I already

137
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,809
 told you, we just call it

138
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,410
 the CDF of X.

139
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,029
 Now, this definition

140
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,710
 immediately applies some

141
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,610
 nice characteristic properties

142
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:55,550
 for FX.

143
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:57,869
 Therefore, let's use a minute

144
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,270
 to talk about these.

145
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:01,940
 They immediately follow because

146
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:03,520
 we use a probability measure

147
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:05,240
 to define F of X.

148
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,619
 For example, if we make this

149
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,369
 lowercase X here smaller

150
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,139
 and smaller in the limit

151
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:12,880
 X to minus infinity,

152
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:14,929
 we would get PX of

153
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,010
 the empty set.

154
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,089
 And then we have our important

155
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,329
 property of a probability

156
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:19,820
 measure.

157
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,660
 The empty set is always

158
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,730
 sent to zero.

159
00:04:23,549 --> 00:04:25,410
 Hence FX has

160
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,049
 this property in the limit

161
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,410
 to minus infinity.

162
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:30,779
 Therefore, in the same way,

163
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,279
 we can ask what happens when

164
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,230
 X goes to plus infinity

165
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:36,399
 there, it's also not hard

166
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,660
 to see when X

167
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,540
 increases.

168
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:40,250
 We include more and more

169
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,579
 in this probability measure.

170
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:43,660
 Hence, in the limit we get

171
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,890
 here the whole real number

172
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:45,410
 line.

173
00:04:45,429 --> 00:04:47,410
 So we have PX of R

174
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:50,109
 and this is the next important

175
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,459
 property of a probability

176
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,000
 measure.

177
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:53,570
 The whole sample space is

178
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:55,109
 always sent to one.

179
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:56,510
 OK.

180
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,950
 So it's not hard to see that

181
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,369
 we have these two limits

182
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,350
 for FX.

183
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:03,179
 Moreover, we also see

184
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,720
 immediately that the function

185
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,380
 FX is monotonically

186
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,140
 increasing.

187
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:08,359
 Here.

188
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:09,470
 Please recall.

189
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,160
 This means if we go from

190
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,160
 one point X one to a larger

191
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,130
 point X two, the

192
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,350
 value of the function

193
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,220
 increases or it stays the

194
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,649
 same.

195
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:20,950
 This follows because the

196
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,589
 probability measure is

197
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,869
 always monotonic.

198
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:25,989
 This means if we measure

199
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,450
 a set with the probability

200
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,390
 measure, then all subsets

201
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,119
 of the set have a smaller

202
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,470
 measure all the same.

203
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,970
 So you see also this

204
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,640
 property is not hard to

205
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:37,399
 understand.

206
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,059
 However, now the third and

207
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,799
 the last property here is

208
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:43,329
 a little bit more technical.

209
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:45,739
 I say this because it tells

210
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,690
 us that FX is right

211
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,589
 continuous.

212
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:51,079
 This means that in general

213
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:53,040
 it's not a continuous function

214
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,649
 but it is continuous.

215
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,190
 If you just look from the

216
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,010
 right hand side, this

217
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:59,369
 means we have to look at

218
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,019
 the right limit here where

219
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,679
 X is always larger than the

220
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,739
 point X zero.

221
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,890
 And then right continuity

222
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,540
 means that this limit is

223
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:09,209
 always FX at the

224
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,369
 point X zero.

225
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,670
 And this is the property

226
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:14,010
 we have for the CDF

227
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:15,040
 FX.

228
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,570
 Now the meaning of this in

229
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:19,000
 the graph, you can see a

230
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,839
 buff at each

231
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,510
 jump point as this one.

232
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,279
 The field in circle has to

233
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,579
 lie at the upper part on

234
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:26,149
 the right.

235
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:27,690
 OK.

236
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,700
 I don't want to prove the

237
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:30,420
 fact here, but you should

238
00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:31,640
 see the reason for it.

239
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,649
 We include X here in

240
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,570
 this interval.

241
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,600
 And the jump in the graph

242
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:38,390
 would mean that the singleton

243
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,170
 just with the point X has

244
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:41,609
 a non zero probability.

245
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:43,519
 And this non zero

246
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,070
 probability is then

247
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,450
 included in the whole

248
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:47,540
 probability here.

249
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,970
 OK.

250
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,640
 Then I think we can look

251
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:51,829
 at an example.

252
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,040
 In fact, this will be one

253
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:55,760
 of the most important examples

254
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:57,750
 we have, we take the

255
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,579
 random variable X which should

256
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:01,359
 have the distribution given

257
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:03,119
 by the normal distribution.

258
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:04,920
 If you have already heard

259
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:06,320
 of the normal distribution,

260
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,950
 then you know it has two

261
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,880
 parameters.

262
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:10,799
 And the simplest case would

263
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:12,230
 be that we set the mean to

264
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:14,040
 be zero and the standard

265
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:15,720
 deviation to be one.

266
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:17,959
 If you have never seen this,

267
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,640
 this is not a problem because

268
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:20,940
 now we discuss it,

269
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:23,359
 it's an absolutely continuous

270
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,970
 case, which means the whole

271
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,799
 probability measure is given

272
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:28,269
 by a probability density

273
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:28,799
 function.

274
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,339
 And indeed, this one is

275
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,859
 given by the famous bell

276
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,500
 curve.

277
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,799
 It's not just any bell

278
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:37,429
 curve, it's given by the

279
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,630
 Gaussian function,

280
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,980
 which means it's given by

281
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:42,739
 E to the power minus

282
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,299
 one half X

283
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,850
 squared.

284
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,339
 And the correct normalization

285
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,829
 in font would be given by

286
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,679
 one divided by the square

287
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,480
 root of two times pi

288
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,839
 Now, in general, in the case,

289
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,220
 when we have the probability

290
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,519
 density function, the

291
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:59,480
 PDF, we can easily

292
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:01,140
 calculate the CD F.

293
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:03,209
 In fact, the only thing we

294
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,170
 have to do is to integrate

295
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:06,529
 over the PDF,

296
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:08,690
 which means we go from minus

297
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,209
 infinity to the point

298
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,809
 X.

299
00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:12,779
 And then we only have to

300
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,529
 put in the PDF where the

301
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,350
 constant is written in front

302
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:17,190
 of the integral.

303
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,500
 However, here, because X

304
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,410
 is already chosen as available,

305
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,570
 we need another one.

306
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:23,850
 So let's choose T

307
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,500
 now, for the normal distribution,

308
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,279
 we can simplify this

309
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,720
 integral immediately.

310
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:31,100
 But of course, we can draw

311
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,839
 a graph.

312
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,099
 So we would start with minus

313
00:08:34,109 --> 00:08:35,859
 infinity, then we would increase

314
00:08:35,869 --> 00:08:36,700
 and increase.

315
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,419
 And in the end in the limit,

316
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,200
 we would go to

317
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,179
 +11 important

318
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,500
 property you see here is

319
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,380
 because the PDF is

320
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,179
 symmetric, we will hit

321
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,219
 one half here.

322
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:48,679
 OK.

323
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,280
 Because my drawing here is

324
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:51,770
 not perfect at all.

325
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,320
 I would suggest that we now

326
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,450
 go into our

327
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,359
 studio

328
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,140
 here.

329
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,130
 The first thing we should

330
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,010
 check is the health function.

331
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,219
 So what is the normal

332
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:02,780
 distribution in R?

333
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,450
 Indeed here, you see we have

334
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,229
 everything.

335
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:07,679
 So the whole explanation

336
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,309
 what the normal distribution

337
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,809
 is.

338
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:12,239
 Most importantly, we see

339
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,630
 the probability density

340
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,330
 function is here given

341
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,570
 with the norm.

342
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,940
 On the other hand, the CD

343
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,400
 F, the distribution

344
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:22,020
 function is given by

345
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,890
 P norm.

346
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:25,659
 And the last one here, Ar

347
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,179
 nom will just give us a

348
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,869
 sample with respect to the

349
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,989
 normal distribution.

350
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,460
 Of course, in addition, you

351
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:34,380
 also get a lot of explanations

352
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:34,950
 here.

353
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:36,609
 Most importantly, you

354
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:38,419
 see the definition

355
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:39,789
 of the probability density

356
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,549
 function is also given

357
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:41,900
 here.

358
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,299
 However, you see the parameter

359
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:45,979
 sigma and the parameter

360
00:09:45,989 --> 00:09:47,590
 mu are included here.

361
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,830
 Nevertheless, the default

362
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,460
 values are the same as we

363
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:52,159
 have chosen.

364
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,440
 OK.

365
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,880
 Then I would say we can play

366
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,640
 around and plot the CD

367
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,190
 F and the PDF.

368
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,229
 Now for plotting, we need

369
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,309
 a whole sequence.

370
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,150
 So let's set X to the

371
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,849
 sequence where we start

372
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:06,690
 maybe with minus 10

373
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,750
 and go to plus 10 with

374
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,390
 step size

375
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,390
 0.01

376
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,489
 let's hit enter.

377
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,909
 And then we see the result

378
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:15,390
 here.

379
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,010
 Indeed, we recognize that

380
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,710
 we have 2001

381
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,409
 points.

382
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:22,549
 Then in the next step, we

383
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,070
 can put all these points

384
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,669
 into the density function

385
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:27,539
 which was given by the

386
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:28,190
 norm.

387
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,489
 OK.

388
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,739
 So here you see the best

389
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,250
 thing would be to enlarge

390
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,140
 the whole picture.

391
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:38,140
 Now, in this picture, we

392
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,080
 recognize our bell curve.

393
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,250
 However, maybe it's better

394
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,450
 to not just plot the

395
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,200
 values but also the

396
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,359
 points X.

397
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:47,809
 So we put in X

398
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,750
 comma the norm of X

399
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,409
 and there you see, we have

400
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,309
 our peak exactly at the point

401
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,940
 X is equal to zero.

402
00:10:56,729 --> 00:10:57,309
 OK.

403
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,960
 Then I would say in the same

404
00:10:58,969 --> 00:11:00,830
 way we can plot this CD

405
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,289
 F.

406
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,630
 So we take X

407
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,510
 comma P norm

408
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,429
 of X.

409
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,460
 So here you see this is like

410
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:10,809
 our picture from before,

411
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,739
 but now from minus 10 to

412
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,500
 plus 10.

413
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,679
 Hence, you can see in the

414
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,679
 limits we go from zero

415
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:18,900
 to plus one.

416
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,270
 Now I would suggest that

417
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,460
 you play around with all

418
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:24,010
 these functions to get a

419
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,429
 good visualization for the

420
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,750
 PDF and for the

421
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,549
 CDF.

422
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:28,840
 OK.

423
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:30,380
 Now, at the end of the video,

424
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,030
 we can also look at the function

425
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,099
 are norm

426
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,059
 and if we put in a number,

427
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,940
 we get as many samples as

428
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,619
 we want.

429
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:41,159
 So in this case, we took

430
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:42,530
 10 but of course, we could

431
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:44,479
 also take 6000 for

432
00:11:44,489 --> 00:11:45,080
 example.

433
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,950
 So showing all of them is

434
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,469
 not so exciting, but

435
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:51,059
 maybe a histogram is.

436
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,659
 So let's put in histogram

437
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:55,359
 of rnorm

438
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,820
 6000.

439
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,739
 And here again, we

440
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,090
 recognize some bell

441
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:02,760
 curve.

442
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,109
 So maybe we can just repeat

443
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:06,200
 the whole thing again.

444
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,159
 And as you can see, we don't

445
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:10,109
 change so much.

446
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:12,729
 However, maybe we can

447
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:14,500
 also increase the number

448
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:17,789
 in another video, I already

449
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,289
 showed you how you can make

450
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:20,489
 a histogram a little bit

451
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,349
 nicer and maybe

452
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:23,390
 this is something you should

453
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,500
 do here as well.

454
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:25,849
 OK.

455
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:27,169
 Now, I think that's good

456
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,530
 enough for this video.

457
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,289
 I really hope you now know

458
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:31,830
 what a normal distribution

459
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,450
 is and also what a

460
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,010
 general CDF is.

461
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,169
 Of course, all questions

462
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:38,640
 you can put into the comments

463
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,429
 and then I hope I see you

464
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,619
 in the next video.

465
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,559
 Bye.
