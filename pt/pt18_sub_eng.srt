Hello and welcome back to probability theory.

2
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:11,769
We've already reached part 18 in the series and we are still talking about the variance and the standard deviation.

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:17,678
More precisely today we will prove some important formulas that hold for independent random variables.

4
00:00:18,814 --> 00:00:23,604
However before we start with this, a big thank you to all my supporters on Steady.

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,653
and as a supporter, you have access to PDF versions and quizzes for all the videos.

7
00:00:34,853 --> 00:00:37,556
Ok, then let's start with the topic of today.

8
00:00:37,756 --> 00:00:41,799
Let's talk about some properties of the variance and the standard deviation

9
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:47,943
and as I said before, we will formulate this for 2 independent random variables X and Y.

10
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:53,440
Moreover we already know from the last videos, that the variance is only well defined,

11
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:57,183
if the integral of the random variables squared exists

12
00:00:57,886 --> 00:01:03,391
or in other words the expectation of X squared has to be a finite number

13
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:07,014
and of course the same we also need for the random variable Y.

14
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:11,533
Which means the expectation of Y squared has to be a finite number as well.

15
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:17,870
OK, with this we now know the variance and the standard deviation of X and Y exist.

16
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:21,786
So all of these are well defined real numbers.

17
00:01:22,286 --> 00:01:27,933
However, now we are also able to say something about the sum of the 2 random variables.

18
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:32,973
More concretely we can now calculate the variance of X + Y

19
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:38,431
and maybe it's not a big surprise for you. In this case the variance is indeed additive.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,653
This means we can simply pull out the plus sign here.

21
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:48,544
However here please don't forget, it's important that the two random variables here are independent.

22
00:01:49,157 --> 00:01:55,209
OK, so this is the addition and now you might ask: what happens when we scale a random variable?

23
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:01,230
So the question is what is the variance of Lambda times X, where Lambda is a real number

24
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:05,799
and in fact, we can pull out this Lambda factor, but with a square.

25
00:02:06,214 --> 00:02:11,538
So we can simplify our variance here, but we shouldn't forget this square outside.

26
00:02:11,738 --> 00:02:18,169
OK, now you might have the idea, that we should formulate the second rule here for the standard deviation as well,

27
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:21,794
because there the square should vanish in the definition.

28
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:29,627
There please recall, the standard deviation Sigma of Lambda times X, is simply the square root of the variance.

29
00:02:29,827 --> 00:02:34,357
This means indeed here on the right-hand side the square of Lambda vanishes,

30
00:02:34,358 --> 00:02:36,568
but now we have the absolute value there.

31
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:41,708
This makes sense, because the standard deviation has to be always positive.

32
00:02:42,286 --> 00:02:47,582
Hence also here you should remember, you can pull out a scalar from the standard deviation,

33
00:02:47,614 --> 00:02:50,390
but then you should forget about the minus signs.

34
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:56,519
In other words if you just look at positive number, this is a homogeneous property.

35
00:02:57,171 --> 00:03:03,146
Now, I would say all the 3 rules here, you should remember, because you can use them in calculations.

36
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:06,819
However, of course first we should prove them.

37
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,492
Indeed this is not a hard proof,

38
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,786
because we can immediately use the formula we have for the variance given by the expectations.

39
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,935
This means the variance of X + Y is given by the difference of two expectations.

40
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:27,981
Please recall in the first one we have the square inside the expectation and in the second one outside

41
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:35,440
and now the good thing we can use here is, that the properties of the expectation, we have already discussed in part 15.

42
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:43,534
In particular we know the expectation is linear and of course this should be something that can help us here.

43
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:49,402
However first here, let's expand the square inside the expectation.

44
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:54,725
So this is X squared + 2 times X times Y + Y squared.

45
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:59,547
So not so complicated and in the next step we can use the linearity here.

46
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:04,286
Moreover here on the right-hand side, we can use the linearity immediately.

47
00:04:04,486 --> 00:04:12,169
So we have the expectation of X + the expectation of Y and still we have to square the whole thing.

48
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,424
Ok, then in the next step let's use the linearity of the expectation here in the first part.

49
00:04:18,814 --> 00:04:22,190
So we can pull out the additions and the scalars.

50
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:33,654
Hence first we have expectation of X squared + 2 times the expectation of X times Y + the expectation of Y squared.

51
00:04:33,854 --> 00:04:39,891
Ok, then on the other hand here the second part we can expand the square as well.

52
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:43,941
So this means first we have the expectation of X squared,

53
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:53,896
then minus 2 times the expectation of X times the expectation of Y and finally we have this squared expectation of Y.

54
00:04:54,529 --> 00:05:01,850
Ok at this point you should see, we can already put this term together with this term to get the variance of X

55
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:09,727
and in the same sense this expectation here and that expectation there gives us the variance of Y.

56
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:14,536
So you see we have already reached what we want here on the right-hand side.

57
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:19,950
Therefore the only question is what is with the 2 remaining terms here?

58
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:23,966
So maybe first to answer this let's put them together.

59
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:31,643
So it's two times then the expectation of X times Y minus the expectation of X times the expectation of Y.

60
00:05:31,843 --> 00:05:35,725
So at this point we know this whole term should be 0

61
00:05:36,157 --> 00:05:41,690
and indeed there the independence of the 2 random variables X and Y comes in,

62
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:49,490
because if they are independent, then this expectation here is just the product of 2 expectations.

63
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:53,704
That's also something we have stated in part 15.

64
00:05:54,214 --> 00:06:03,860
So the conclusion here is, the whole term inside the parentheses here is 0 and this finishes the proof of part (a).

65
00:06:04,286 --> 00:06:12,737
So now let's go to part (b). In fact, part (b) is much easier, because only one random variable is involved here,

66
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:17,517
but again we can use the formula with the expectations for the variance.

67
00:06:17,971 --> 00:06:23,901
So first we have the expectation, where the random variables is squared and then we square the expectation

68
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:28,838
and now you should see in both terms we can pull out a Lambda squared.

69
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:33,442
Again simply by using the linearity of the expectation.

70
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:38,746
Ok and then the only thing we have to do now is to factor out the Lambda squared,

71
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:43,490
because then only the difference of the two expectations remains

72
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:49,791
and we have used this formula so often now, that you immediately see this is the variance of X.

73
00:06:49,991 --> 00:06:59,269
In other words we have proven part (b) and also not a surprise at all from part (b), we now can derive part (c).

74
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:05,676
Essentially part (c) was the same thing, but now for the standard deviation instead of the variance.

75
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,850
Hence the only thing we have to do here, is to take the square root of the variance

76
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:16,349
and then by using part (b), we see we have the square root of Lambda squared

77
00:07:16,843 --> 00:07:21,329
and indeed this is simply now the absolute value of Lambda

78
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:27,716
and the other factor is just this square root of the variance of X, which is the standard deviation of X.

79
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:32,241
Ok and with this you see the whole proof is finished.

80
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:39,494
So as I said please remember all these properties, all the formulas here, because you can use them in calculations

81
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:43,786
and indeed how to do that, we will see in the next videos.

82
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:48,143
Therefore I really hope that I see you there and have a nice day. Bye!
