Hello and welcome back to probability theory.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:09,086
and as you know, first i want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:17,257
Now, in todays part 8 we will talk about 2 important formulas. Namely about the total probability formula and about Bayes's theorem.

4
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:21,751
This formula of Bayes is so famous that we should immediately start with this.

5
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:29,176
However it's not so complicated at all, because we already know the conditional probability of an event A under B.

6
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:34,768
Which is simply given by the probability of the intersection divided by the probability of B.

7
00:00:34,814 --> 00:00:41,001
and now of course we can also flip the roles and look at the conditional probability of B under the event A.

8
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:45,778
Then we also have the intersection, but then we divide by probability of A.

9
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:50,335
However, the important part here is: the intersection is the same.

10
00:00:50,535 --> 00:00:53,731
Hence with this part we can put both equations together.

11
00:00:53,931 --> 00:01:03,992
Which leads us for left hand side to P(A|B) times P(B) and on the right hand side it leads us to P(B|A) times P(A).

12
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:08,144
and in fact, this is what we call Bayes's theorem.

13
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:16,001
In this order it's easy to remember, because here we have the condition B and P(B) and here the condition A and P(A).

14
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:20,743
Ok, at the end of the video i can show you how we can use this formula.

15
00:01:20,943 --> 00:01:25,141
However before we do this lets talk about the law of total probability.

16
00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:29,446
It tells us which possibilities we have to split up a probability.

17
00:01:29,814 --> 00:01:37,196
So as always we choose a probability space given by a sample space Omega, a sigma algebra A and the probability measure P.

18
00:01:37,557 --> 00:01:41,254
and now we want to calculate the probability of a subset A.

19
00:01:41,454 --> 00:01:44,543
So the question is: how can we split up P(A)?

20
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,528
Now, one possibility would be to choose another set B.

21
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:52,376
In the picture we can also visualize this maybe like this.

22
00:01:52,576 --> 00:01:57,578
So the set B is here and you immediately see how this set A is divided now.

23
00:01:57,886 --> 00:02:01,813
We get this, because we have the set B and the complement of B.

24
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:07,170
and of course both together in a union gives us the whole sample space Omega.

25
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,866
Important to note here is, this is indeed a disjoint union.

26
00:02:11,543 --> 00:02:15,459
Therefore this division here works no matter which event A we choose.

27
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:18,569
and this is now what we can put into a formula.

28
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:23,058
So we have P(A), where we can write A as a disjoint union.

29
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,123
Namely the union of the upper part here we have in B, with the other part we have in B^c.

30
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:35,367
and because this is a disjoint union, we can use the property of the measure and write it as a sum.

31
00:02:35,743 --> 00:02:40,438
So we have the probability of this intersection + the probability of that intersection.

32
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:44,957
Now as before an intersection we can rewrite as a conditional probability.

33
00:02:45,557 --> 00:02:49,536
For the first one we write P(A|B) times P(B).

34
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:54,087
and for the second one we use the same formula, but now with the complement of B.

35
00:02:54,287 --> 00:03:01,410
So you see, this is a nice formula, we can use to calculate the probability of A, when we know these 4 probabilities here.

36
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,717
However the law of total probability goes even further.

37
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:11,573
We can also deal with the case that we don't have only one set B, but countably many.

38
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:15,888
So we could have 2, 3 or even infinitely many.

39
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:21,553
Hence we simply say we have B_i, where i comes from the index set that is a subset of the natural numbers.

40
00:03:21,943 --> 00:03:25,420
and of course we have to generalize this property here.

41
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:29,788
This means that the union of all these sets is equal to Omega.

42
00:03:29,988 --> 00:03:33,829
and in addition as before, it needs to be a disjoint union.

43
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:37,293
Now lets also visualize this in a picture.

44
00:03:37,614 --> 00:03:43,243
There is our sample space Omega again and now we don't just find one set B, but a lot of them.

45
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:46,957
For example such a decomposition of Omega could look like this.

46
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,884
and here please don't forget it's possible that we have infinitely many sets B_i.

47
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:57,015
Therefore in this picture they would get thinner and thinner when we go in this direction, for example.

48
00:03:57,215 --> 00:04:00,070
Of course there are a lot possibilities to visualize this.

49
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:06,138
However the important part here is that we also have a set A of which we want to calculate the probability.

50
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,057
In fact this now works exactly with the same steps as before.

51
00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:14,559
So first we can write a set A as a disjoint union.

52
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:21,532
Of course this is again, the intersection with the B_i's. Which means in the picture we just put all these parts here together.

53
00:04:21,732 --> 00:04:27,395
Ok then because it's a disjoint union, we can use the sigma additivity of the measure.

54
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:32,502
So we get out this sum for the probabilities or a series when we have infinitely many.

55
00:04:32,702 --> 00:04:36,343
However in both cases we can us the conditional probabilities again.

56
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:42,029
So we have the sum of P(A|B_i) times the probability of B_i.

57
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:46,685
Now, this formula here is indeed the general law of total probability.

58
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:50,608
And how we can apply we will see in the next example.

59
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:55,639
Actually this is one of the most famous examples of probability theory.

60
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:58,698
It's the so called Monty Hall problem.

61
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:03,922
and because it is so well known, i don't want to go into the whole history and the details.

62
00:05:04,122 --> 00:05:08,029
We just use it to compute a probability with the 2 laws above.

63
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:11,635
However i still have to explain how this whole puzzle works.

64
00:05:11,835 --> 00:05:18,436
So we have a game show with 3 doors, where there is one door with a car behind and 2 doors with a goat behind.

65
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:22,744
and now lets assume that the car would be the better price to win.

66
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:25,543
Ok then the game works in 3 steps.

67
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:29,350
First you pick a door. Lets say you pick door 1.

68
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,870
Afterwards in the second step the showmaster always shows you a goat.

69
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,638
So he opens one of the 2 remaining doors.

70
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:39,771
and maybe lets say here he opens door 3.

71
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,760
and then in the last step you have to do your final pick.

72
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,292
So you can either keep the original door or you can switch.

73
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:52,373
and now i can already tell you, switching has the higher probability to getting the car.

74
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:56,688
Therefore if you want the goat you should stay at the original door.

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,546
However no matter what you want, we can calculate the probabilities now.

76
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:04,489
Here please note, the names for the doors are arbitrary.

77
00:06:04,654 --> 00:06:09,542
So we can call the first door we pick just (1).

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,486
Moreover we need some names for the events we consider here.

79
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,498
Here c_j should be the event that the car is behind door j.

80
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:23,450
In addition s_j should be event that in the second step the showmaster opens door j.

81
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:26,823
Hence we already know some conditional probabilities.

82
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:30,000
And in order to make our life a little bitte easier,

83
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,069
Let's only consider the case that the show master opens door 3. The other interesting case with  S_2 can be described in the same way.

84
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:43,967
Okay, so in this case we already some conditional probabilities.

85
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:50,793
Namely the probability of s_3 under the condition c_3 has to be 0.

86
00:06:51,847 --> 00:06:53,752
The showmaster will never show you the car in the second step.

87
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,450
He always opens a door with a goat.

88
00:06:57,488 --> 00:07:02,222
Therefore we also now the probability of s_3 under the condition c_2.

89
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:06,511
Because this is what i told you, he opens one of the 2 remaining doors.

90
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,547
Never the door you picked.

91
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:11,532
So in this scenario here, he does not have a choice.

92
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,247
Hence the conditional probability here is 1.

93
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:20,973
Then the last remaining case would be where he has a choice. Therefore we say the probability is 1/2.

94
00:07:20,993 --> 00:07:25,707
So you see, just by knowing the problem we already get a lot of information.

95
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:32,391
And please also note, here we didn't define a sample space, sigma algebra or even a probability measure yet.

96
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:39,834
Simply because we don't need it. We just want to know what happens in any probability space, when we have these conditional probabilities.

97
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:42,996
Indeed this will be our last step here.

98
00:07:43,643 --> 00:07:49,262
So we want to know: what is the probability of getting the car when i switch the door in the third step.

99
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:52,422
And this is exactly given by this conditional probability.

100
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,854
Now, maybe not so surprising now we can apply Bayes's theorem here.

101
00:07:58,462 --> 00:07:59,840
Please recall what it tells us.

102
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,899
We can exchange the order in the conditional probability here, when multiply with the probability of the last part.

103
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:11,462
However we don't have it on the left hand side. Therefore we have to divide here by the probability of s_3.

104
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:15,460
Therefore often you see Bayes's theorem in this formulation.

105
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:21,712
Ok, now here on the right hand side we have a problem, because we don't know what P(s_3) is.

106
00:08:21,712 --> 00:08:28,132
However we have all the conditional probabilities here. Therefore we can use the law of total probability.

107
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:32,324
Hence in the denominator we get a sum with 3 parts.

108
00:08:32,482 --> 00:08:38,701
Namely we sum over P(s_3|c_j) times the probability of c_j.

109
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:42,359
and there we can put in our conditional probabilities.

110
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:47,571
Ok then lets start in the numerator. This probability here is 1.

111
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:51,036
and the same we find here in the denominator as well.

112
00:08:51,513 --> 00:08:55,894
Then on the right hand side we find a conditional probability that is 0.

113
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:59,778
and then the last remaining one on the left is 1/2.

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,727
Ok now you see the last ingredient we need would be the probability of c_2 and c_1.

115
00:09:06,134 --> 00:09:10,346
and there of course we have the assumption that it's the same probability.

116
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:15,425
So we assume fair game. Each door has the same probability for getting the price.

117
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:20,083
and by having 3 doors this would mean we have the probability 1/3.

118
00:09:20,808 --> 00:09:25,869
Ok, now we have substituted everything with numbers, such that we can simply compute.

119
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:27,643
and we get out 2/3.

120
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,819
So indeed we get out the result that in this scenario switching is beneficial.

121
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:42,339
However of course the goal here was not winning a car, but rather seeing the application of Bayes's theorem and law of total probability.

122
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:48,837
Ok with this i think it's good enough for today and i hope i see you in the next video. Have a nice day and Bye! :) :)
