Hello and welcome back to Probability

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,360
Theory the video course where we learn

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,480
how to calculate in probability

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,639
spaces. And in today's part 26 we will

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,760
talk about two famous inequalities named

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,960
after Markov and

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:23,160
Chebyshev. Both can be used in applications

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,599
because they hold in a general setting.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,840
However before we start stating these

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,560
inequalities, I first want to thank all

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,120
the nice people who support the channel

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,719
on Steady, here on YouTube, or via other

13
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,360
means and please don't forget supporting

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,559
me gives you benefits: so for example you

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,000
can download additional material with

16
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:43,200
the link in the

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,079
description. Okay then let's start

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,960
formulating these two inequalities for

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,079
probability space so we have a sample

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,800
space Omega a sigma algebra a and a

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,840
probability measure

22
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,399
P and there I can already tell you the

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,399
power of maros inequality and chabby

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:06,000
chf's inqu quality lies in the fact that

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,920
they are valid in any probability space

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,080
and as we will see now they are also not

27
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,400
hard to prove at all so let's start with

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,880
the first one here let's start with

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,600
markov's

30
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,479
inequality this one holds for any random

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,640
variable defined on the probability

32
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:28,079
space this means we consider a map X

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,840
from Omega into R so as always we

34
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,119
consider real Valu random

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,240
variables however what we actually need

36
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,280
for maros inequality is a non- negative

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,759
random variable therefore what we do is

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,119
to go through the absolute value of x

39
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:49,079
because this one now has non- negative

40
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:50,439
values and it satisfies what we call

41
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,159
markov's

42
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:56,280
inequality and in short this one just

43
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,039
Compares a probability with the

44
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,360
expectation more precisely we look at

45
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:04,560
the probability that the absolute value

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,560
of x is greater or equal than a given

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,759
Epsilon so this is the given event which

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,200
we can measure with our probability

49
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,440
measure and the probability that comes

50
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,879
out is less or equal than an

51
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,920
expectation indeed we can write

52
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:23,720
expectation of the random variable

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,879
absolute value of x to the power p and

54
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:30,160
then we divide that by Epsilon to the

55
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,879
power p as well so this is Mark of

56
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,680
inequality and it holds no matter which

57
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,640
positive Epsilon or P we choose in this

58
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,440
sense it's very flexible and in

59
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,680
particular it also holds for p is equal

60
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,480
to 1 and exactly this case we can

61
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,319
immediately visualize this is not

62
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,360
complicated at all let's sketch a graph

63
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,239
for our random variable X or as you

64
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,400
already know we actually want to have

65
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,560
the non- negative random variable

66
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,599
absolute value of x hence here the

67
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,680
x-axis just represents the whole sample

68
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,040
space

69
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,360
Omega and then the values of X just give

70
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,840
us a graph in this picture and now what

71
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,920
we can do is just fix an Epsilon here on

72
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,720
the Y AIS and then we immediately

73
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,879
recognize the samples where the absolute

74
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,879
value of x is greater or equal than

75
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:30,159
Epsilon more precisely we just find them

76
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,480
here and there so in the picture we can

77
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,200
just project them back to the sample

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:39,159
space Omega hence the subset in Omega we

79
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,280
want to measure is this one combined

80
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:44,120
with that one in other words by

81
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,760
measuring that with our probability

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,480
measure P we already have the left hand

83
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:53,480
side here and now if you multiply this

84
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,680
by the value Epsilon we get out the two

85
00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:00,519
rectangles here so you can say what we

86
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:03,120
have is these two areas added

87
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,959
however on the other hand you know that

88
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,959
the expectation of a random variable is

89
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:11,319
given by the whole integral hence

90
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,959
obviously the area given by the whole

91
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:16,680
integral is bigger than just the two

92
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:19,040
rectangles here or in general we

93
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,600
immediately have the inequality with

94
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,400
less or equal here so it's easy to see

95
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,120
and this is the whole Mark of inequality

96
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:32,240
for the case p is equal to 1 and in fact

97
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,120
this idea here already covers the whole

98
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,680
proof the only thing we have to do now

99
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,600
is to extend it to any P this means here

100
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,960
in the picture instead of the absolute

101
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,039
value of x we consider the absolute

102
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,280
value of x to the^ P this does not

103
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:52,240
change so much because the set we

104
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,320
calculate here is the same for any P so

105
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,160
if we have a lowercase Omega which

106
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,080
satisfies the one inequality it also

107
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,680
satisfies the other one simply because

108
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,639
the power of p is a monotonically

109
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,240
increasing function therefore the

110
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,680
measured probability here is also

111
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,360
exactly the same and now as before we

112
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,680
want to multiply the whole thing by the

113
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,440
value we have but now the value is

114
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:23,360
Epsilon to the power P so let's simply

115
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,479
put Epsilon to the power P to both sides

116
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,800
and now here on the right hand side we

117
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:30,840
can do exactly the same estimate as

118
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,560
before in the picture but maybe as an

119
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,440
explanation we can put in one more step

120
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,400
in between namely we introduce the

121
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,199
indicator function this one you know we

122
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:45,319
write it with a bolt one where in the

123
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:48,440
index we find the corresponding set and

124
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:51,720
here we have the set where X to^ P is

125
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:54,319
greater or equal than Epsilon to the^ p

126
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,840
and for this indicator function we can

127
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,199
calculate the

128
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,560
expectation which is exactly the

129
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,840
probability here on on the left hand

130
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,400
side so we still have equalities here

131
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,479
and in the next step we can pull in the

132
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,120
factor Epsilon to the power P which

133
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:15,039
means now we have an expectation of a

134
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,599
step function and there you can look

135
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,680
back to the picture where we exactly

136
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,800
have this function there so the graph

137
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,039
has a line here and there and otherwise

138
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,960
it's at zero however the crucial part

139
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,960
here is that the whole graph of the

140
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,199
function lies below the graph of the

141
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:38,000
function X to the^ P hence the

142
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,440
monotonicity of the integral or the

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,080
expectation tells us that we have the

144
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,080
inequality so in the calculation here we

145
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,800
get that we have less or equal than the

146
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,840
expectation of the absolute value of x

147
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,039
to the power p and now if you compare

148
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,240
this to the left hand side you see that

149
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,639
we have proven Mark of's

150
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,919
inequality so you see that was very

151
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,120
quick and the whole idea was in the

152
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,919
picture above in other words what we see

153
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,759
it's a very rough estimate in general

154
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,080
but we can use it whenever we want and

155
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,120
the first application we have is to use

156
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,560
it to prove the famous chabby chfs

157
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,840
inequality this one can be used to

158
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,879
estimate How likely it is to be off from

159
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,840
the expectation of a given random

160
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:29,280
variable and again the power of this

161
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:32,000
lies in the general setting you can use

162
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,599
this estimate for any random variable

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,280
where the expectation is defined

164
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:38,440
therefore this is the only assumption we

165
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,560
have here we have a chosen random

166
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:45,319
variable X and there we want that e of X

167
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,039
exists or as you know you can formulate

168
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:50,759
that that the expectation of the

169
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,520
absolute value of x is finite indeed

170
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,720
here we need an expectation for the

171
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,599
random variable X because otherwise the

172
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,360
formulation would not make sense and as

173
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,879
already said in the formulation we look

174
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,159
at the set where we deviate from the

175
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,240
expectation of X more precisely we want

176
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:12,680
to see how likely it is to be off by a

177
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,080
given Epsilon in other words these are

178
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,879
the points in the sample space Omega

179
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,840
where we are not in an Epsilon

180
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:23,759
neighborhood of the expectation for the

181
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,800
values of X and exactly this Subspace in

182
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,080
Omega we can measure with the

183
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,599
probability measure and now the variance

184
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,760
of the the random variable X gives us an

185
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,519
upper Bound for this

186
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:41,599
probability more concretely we have the

187
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:44,560
variance of x / Epsilon s moreover you

188
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:48,399
immediately see that this inequality is

189
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,640
only useful if the variance of X is also

190
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,720
a finite number but if we have that then

191
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,800
the variance here gives a nice estimate

192
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,920
for the probability that a random

193
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,360
variable deviates from its mean and

194
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,959
indeed it does not matter which Epsilon

195
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,240
greater than zero you choose here okay

196
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:11,360
now with the statement in mind I would

197
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,040
say we can try to write down a proof for

198
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,560
it and there what we can immediately do

199
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,600
to simplify the whole thing is to

200
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,079
consider a random variable where the

201
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,720
expectation is zero so in other words we

202
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:27,920
just consider X tilder which is given as

203
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,880
x minus the expectation this is really

204
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,680
helpful because it means that the

205
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:37,839
variance of XA is just given as the

206
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,720
expectation of X squ so here you see we

207
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,399
need the formulas we have for

208
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,040
calculating

209
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,120
variances in particular you should see

210
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:50,079
that the variance of X and xti are

211
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,079
exactly the same this is simply because

212
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,640
the variance as a function is additive

213
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:59,440
and the variance of a constant is always

214
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,320
zero okay so this is the whole idea to

215
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,000
simplify the inequality and now we can

216
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,600
write it down so the left hand side here

217
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,320
is already very simple because we just

218
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,800
have the probability where absolute

219
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,120
value of xtia is involved but there you

220
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,360
should immediately see that this looks

221
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,680
exactly like the statement in Markos

222
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,839
inequality and since we have the power

223
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,839
of two here involved in the variance we

224
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:30,920
should use Markos inequality for p is

225
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,440
equal to 2 and there you see this is the

226
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,680
reason why we have formulated Markos

227
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,839
inequality for all values P okay and now

228
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,600
on the right hand side here you see we

229
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,279
get a fraction where we have the

230
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,760
expectation of x to the S and Epsilon

231
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,000
squared in the denominator and now

232
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,279
please note for the square it does not

233
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,200
matter if we have the absolute value or

234
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:58,360
not in other words what we have in the

235
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,560
numerator here is just the variance of

236
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,000
our random varable X so exactly what

237
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,279
chabby chf's inequality

238
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,959
stated therefore the proof here is

239
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:14,240
already finished so our general result

240
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:17,480
here is that we have two inequalities

241
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,839
which hold in a very general context

242
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,959
this means you can use this estimate

243
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,120
here for a lot of probability

244
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,880
distributions therefore we can use it

245
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,160
for proofs in general statements but

246
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,360
also in applications

247
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,920
and I would say we first should look at

248
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,680
some concrete examples so let's do that

249
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,020
with the next video so really hope we

250
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:48,029
meet there again and have a nice day

251
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:48,029
