00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,279
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,289 --> 00:00:04,070
 probability theory

3
00:00:04,619 --> 00:00:06,030
 and as always, first, I want

4
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,380
 to thank all the nice people

5
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:08,329
 that support this channel

6
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,619
 on Steady or PayPal.

7
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,000
 And today in part 11, we

8
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,479
 will talk about the distribution

9
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:14,829
 of a random variable.

10
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:16,940
 So therefore, please first

11
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,479
 recall, a random variable

12
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:20,479
 acts between two event spaces.

13
00:00:20,569 --> 00:00:22,309
 It's given as a map capital

14
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:23,940
 X from Omega to

15
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:24,840
 Omega tilde

16
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,270
 and in fact, the most important

17
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,600
 random variables occur,

18
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,069
 when Omega tilde is given

19
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:31,989
 as the real number line R

20
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,919
 and then a useful choice

21
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,479
 for the Sigma algebra is

22
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,860
 given by the Borel Sigma

23
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:38,540
 algebra.

24
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:39,740
 OK.

25
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,060
 Now, these are the random

26
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:42,340
 variables we will talk about

27
00:00:42,349 --> 00:00:42,919
 today.

28
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:45,159
 The overall idea for today

29
00:00:45,169 --> 00:00:46,650
 is that on the one hand,

30
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:48,049
 you have to think of an abstract

31
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,680
 probability space given by

32
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:50,279
 Omega

33
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,290
 and on the other hand, we

34
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:53,750
 have a very concrete probability

35
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,650
 space given by the real number

36
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:56,090
 line.

37
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,430
 I said probability spaces,

38
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,909
 because this is what we will

39
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:00,840
 have in the end.

40
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:02,310
 But of course, first, we

41
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:03,830
 will start just with event

42
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,550
 spaces.

43
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,040
 So most importantly, a probability

44
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,099
 measure on the right-hand

45
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,620
 side is still missing.

46
00:01:10,309 --> 00:01:11,500
 Now corresponding to the

47
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,809
 two event spaces

48
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,239
 I would say we have a random

49
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:15,540
 variable we call capital

50
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,169
 X.

51
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,809
 From the last video, you

52
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:19,489
 already know this map has

53
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,120
 one property we call

54
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,010
 measurable

55
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,110
 and soon you will see why

56
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,410
 we really need that.

57
00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:27,720
 However, first, I would say

58
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,639
 let's add a probability measure

59
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:30,989
 on the left-hand side.

60
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,260
 So we have an abstract probability

61
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:35,099
 measure P defined on the

62
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,430
 Sigma algebra A.

63
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,449
 However, now we are not

64
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:39,680
 interested in abstract

65
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,019
 calculations here on the

66
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:42,910
 left-hand side, because our

67
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:44,870
 whole problem is given with

68
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,319
 this random variable X.

69
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,139
 So we would rather like to

70
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,389
 calculate here on the right-

71
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,750
 hand side with real

72
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,419
 numbers.

73
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:53,629
 Hence, what we want to add

74
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:55,190
 is a probability measure

75
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,550
 for the real number line

76
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:58,099
 for the Borel Sigma algebra.

77
00:01:58,669 --> 00:02:00,610
 So we introduce a new probability

78
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,470
 measure and since it corresponds

79
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,139
 to the random viable X, we

80
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,510
 call it P_X.

81
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:07,930
 Of course, this is a nice

82
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,320
 picture you really should

83
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,210
 always have in mind, but

84
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,830
 it does not tell us what

85
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:14,289
 the definition of P_X

86
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,839
 is.

87
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:17,190
 Therefore, let's do this

88
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,160
 in a definition.

89
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:19,320
 Here

90
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,160
 we will explain what we mean

91
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:22,960
 when we say distribution

92
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,509
 of a random variable X

93
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,750
 and in fact, this is a very

94
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,770
 general definition.

95
00:02:27,779 --> 00:02:29,589
 It works for any probability

96
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,130
 space given by a set

97
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:33,089
 Omega, a Sigma algebra A,

98
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,570
 and the probability measure

99
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,009
 P

100
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,990
 and the only other thing

101
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,539
 we need is a random variable

102
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,520
 X from Omega into

103
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:42,339
 R. Of course, as

104
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,990
 before the Sigma algebra,

105
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,419
 we choose for the real number

106
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:46,990
 line is the Borel Sigma

107
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,610
 algebra.

108
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,360
 So you see the whole assumptions

109
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:51,979
 fit with this picture here.

110
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,369
 Therefore, in the next step,

111
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,080
 we can define the map

112
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:56,949
 P_X.

113
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,089
 Which should have the Borel

114
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,740
 Sigma algebra as its

115
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,339
 domain.

116
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,259
 And because it should be

117
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,130
 a probability measure

118
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:05,729
 in the end, we can say it

119
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,529
 maps into

120
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:07,899
 [0,1].

121
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,660
 Now to define the map, let's

122
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:11,610
 take any Borel set B

123
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:13,509
 and write P_X of

124
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,449
 B is equal to

125
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,990
 P, the abstract

126
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,339
 P, of

127
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:21,509
 the preimage of

128
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,149
 B under X.

129
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,539
 So you see this is a very

130
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,130
 natural construction when

131
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:28,910
 we have any set here and

132
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,589
 want to measure it, we pull

133
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,300
 it back to the original space

134
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:33,869
 here and measure it with

135
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,270
 P.

136
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,970
 And then this whole construction

137
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:38,809
 defines a new measure here

138
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,929
 on the right-hand side.

139
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,389
 Now, as a reminder, you already

140
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:44,149
 know there is another notation

141
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,740
 for denoting the preimage

142
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,100
 in probability theory.

143
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,619
 One simply writes X

144
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,369
 in B.

145
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,710
 Hence, you could also see

146
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,660
 this as a definition for

147
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:55,500
 P_X.

148
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:56,669
 OK.

149
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:58,429
 Now this map P_X

150
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,309
 is what we call the distribution

151
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,059
 of the random variable X.

152
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,690
 More concretely one would

153
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:05,660
 say probability distribution

154
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:07,460
 of X and

155
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,759
 sometimes you also see the

156
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,169
 long name probability

157
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:11,919
 distribution measure of X.

158
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:14,000
 It all means the same.

159
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:15,350
 Namely this map

160
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,279
 P_X.

161
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,869
 However, of course, the important

162
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,690
 part here is, this actually

163
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,369
 defines a probability measure

164
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,149
 on R.

165
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,320
 So let's put that into a

166
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:27,250
 proposition. So

167
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,700
 you see this is a good point

168
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:30,290
 to refresh your memory,

169
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:31,970
 What we need for a probability

170
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,970
 measure. Essentially, we

171
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,450
 just have two properties,

172
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:36,980
 where the actual hard one

173
00:04:36,989 --> 00:04:38,309
 is the so-called sigma

174
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,149
 additivity.

175
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:41,220
 Now, of course, in the proof

176
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,829
 we can use, that we already

177
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,730
 know that this P, the blue

178
00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:46,649
 one, is already a probability

179
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,109
 measure.

180
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:49,420
 And the other part we need

181
00:04:49,429 --> 00:04:51,410
 to use is that X is a random

182
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:51,929
 variable.

183
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,250
 So it's measurable.

184
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,359
 OK.

185
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:56,140
 Then I would say let's start

186
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:57,510
 with a simple fact

187
00:04:58,029 --> 00:04:59,750
 Namely that the preimage

188
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,589
 of the whole set on the right,

189
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,320
 is the whole set on the left-

190
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:03,950
 hand side.

191
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,100
 So this is simply Omega

192
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:07,450
 and of course, this holds

193
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,190
 for every map from Omega

194
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,019
 into R.

195
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,040
 And with this fact, we can

196
00:05:12,049 --> 00:05:13,630
 calculate P_X of

197
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,570
 R. By definition

198
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:17,369
 it's simply P of the pre-

199
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:19,010
 image of R, which is

200
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:19,570
 Omega.

201
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,890
 So we have P of Omega

202
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:23,799
 which is one, because P

203
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:25,250
 is a probability measure.

204
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:27,739
 So you see this was not

205
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,000
 complicated at all

206
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,359
 and now we can do exactly

207
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:33,149
 the same for the empty set.

208
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:35,239
 Not so surprising.

209
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,750
 The preimage of the empty

210
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,420
 set is always the empty

211
00:05:38,429 --> 00:05:38,839
 set.

212
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:39,760
 OK.

213
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:41,190
 Then I would say let's shorten

214
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,859
 the whole calculation, because

215
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:44,519
 it works the same as above.

216
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,549
 In the end, we get P of the

217
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:48,390
 empty set, which is zero

218
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,070
 by the definition of a probability

219
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:50,519
 measure.

220
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,700
 OK.

221
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:53,100
 And with this, we have already

222
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:54,559
 proven half of the things

223
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,359
 we need for having a probability

224
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:56,769
 measure.

225
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,140
 Hence, only the Sigma

226
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:01,079
 additivity remains to show.

227
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,299
 In order to prove this, we

228
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:04,660
 need to choose countable

229
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,869
 many Borel sets.

230
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,470
 So B_1 B_2 and so

231
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,410
 on, and you know they

232
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,220
 should be pairwise disjoint.

233
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,700
 So the intersection with

234
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:14,579
 any two sets is always

235
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:15,529
 the empty set.

236
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,880
 Now, the good thing we have

237
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,420
 is that this stays also

238
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:21,410
 true for the preimages.

239
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,440
 Again, this is a fact that

240
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,089
 holds for any map from

241
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,299
 Omega into R,

242
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,790
 because the preimage has

243
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:30,410
 the general property that

244
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,609
 it is stable under

245
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:32,649
 intersections.

246
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,100
 In other words, we can pull

247
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:36,619
 in the intersection here.

248
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,390
 And now by assumption B_i

249
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:41,459
 and B_j are disjoint,

250
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:43,329
 this is the empty set

251
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,059
 and then we have the same

252
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,899
 as before. The preimage

253
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,540
 of the empty set is the

254
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:49,489
 empty set.

255
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,519
 Hence the conclusion here

256
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:53,359
 is, these countable many

257
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:55,290
 preimages are also

258
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:56,649
 pairwise disjoint.

259
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:58,829
 Of course, this is a very

260
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,679
 nice fact, but we should not

261
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,380
 forget that by the definition

262
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,329
 of a random variable, these

263
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:06,100
 preimages lie in the

264
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:07,429
 sigma algebra A

265
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,910
 and this is needed when we

266
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,880
 want to use the Sigma additivity

267
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,540
 for the original probability

268
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:14,390
 measure P

269
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,970
 and of course, this is exactly

270
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,420
 what we want to do now.

271
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,779
 So what we should write down

272
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,459
 is P_X of the

273
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,940
 infinite union of

274
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,799
 B_J.

275
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:27,329
 Then in the next step as

276
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:29,170
 before we use the definition

277
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:30,309
 of P_X.

278
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,609
 So now we have P

279
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,429
 of the preimage of the infinite

280
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,929
 union.

281
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:37,160
 Hence, what we want to use

282
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,000
 here is again a general

283
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,559
 fact for preimages.

284
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:42,690
 In particular, I can tell

285
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,619
 you the preimage is stable

286
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,369
 under any unions.

287
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:48,579
 In other words, we are allowed

288
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:50,329
 to pull out the union here

289
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,540
 and there you see we have

290
00:07:52,549 --> 00:07:54,440
 what we want. A union of

291
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,059
 pairwise disjoint sets

292
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,140
 inside P.

293
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,540
 Hence, finally, we use the

294
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:01,459
 Sigma additivity for P.

295
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,480
 So the whole thing is the

296
00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:05,440
 infinite sum of P

297
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,369
 of the preimage of B_J

298
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,359
 under X.

299
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,779
 Which we can translate back

300
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,820
 to P_X.

301
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:14,109
 This results in the infinite

302
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,619
 sum of P_X

303
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,220
 (B_J)

304
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:18,329
 and there you see this is

305
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:19,890
 exactly what we wanted to

306
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:20,480
 prove.

307
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,100
 We have the Sigma additivity for

308
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:25,070
 P_X and also the two

309
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,760
 other rules here, such that

310
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:28,519
 we get a probability measure.

311
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,279
 So please keep that fact

312
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,859
 in mind. The distribution

313
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:33,330
 of a random variable is

314
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,190
 always a probability measure.

315
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,429
 And this is exactly what

316
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,049
 we wanted at the beginning.

317
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:40,869
 Now, before we talk about

318
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,729
 examples, I first have to

319
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,087
 tell you about an important

320
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:44,749
 notation,

321
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:47,510
 Namely, if we have a probability

322
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,229
 measure which we could call

323
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:51,200
 P tilde on the real number

324
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:51,640
 line

325
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,820
 and now we find out that

326
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,289
 the probability distribution

327
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:57,020
 of X, P_X, is

328
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,869
 exactly equal to this P

329
00:08:59,159 --> 00:08:59,450
 tilde,

330
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:01,719
 then in this case, we

331
00:09:01,729 --> 00:09:02,950
 write X tilde ~

332
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,400
 P tilde.

333
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:06,979
 Moreover, we read it as

334
00:09:06,989 --> 00:09:08,719
 X is distributed as

335
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:10,530
 P tilde. Here

336
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:12,099
 please keep in mind, P tilde

337
00:09:12,109 --> 00:09:13,530
 could be any probability

338
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:15,400
 measure. I call it P

339
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,500
 tilde simply to avoid any

340
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,219
 danger of confusion with

341
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:21,140
 the blue P, which is defined

342
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:21,940
 for Omega.

343
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,479
 However, here P_X and P

344
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:26,299
 tilde are probability measures

345
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:27,659
 for the real number line.

346
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:28,700
 OK.

347
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,789
 Now the last part of the

348
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,270
 video will be a nice

349
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,099
 example.

350
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:33,849
 Let's take a very a common

351
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:34,320
 one.

352
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,859
 The flip of a coin.

353
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,880
 Here, the probability for

354
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,559
 getting heads should be lower

355
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,510
 case p

356
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,039
 and now our probability space

357
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,770
 should represent n tosses

358
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,280
 of the same coin here

359
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:48,070
 with order. OK?

360
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,580
 So you see this probability

361
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,929
 space is not complicated

362
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,510
 at all.

363
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,440
 The set Omega is given as

364
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,219
 the set {0.1} to the

365
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:56,969
 power n, where

366
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,700
 one should represent heads

367
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,169
 and zero tails

368
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:02,080
 and then the Sigma algebra

369
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,679
 is just the power set of

370
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,250
 Omega.

371
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:06,289
 Hence, the only question

372
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:08,190
 remains, what is the probability

373
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,280
 measure P here?

374
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:11,739
 Indeed, it has a name, it's

375
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,349
 called the Bernoulli distribution

376
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:15,030
 with parameters n and

377
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:15,489
 p.

378
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,599
 Indeed the probability mass

379
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:18,789
 function you can immediately

380
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,580
 write down.

381
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,270
 It's not complicated at all.

382
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,630
 We have factors p and

383
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,489
 1 minus p where p

384
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,460
 comes in for heads and 1

385
00:10:27,469 --> 00:10:28,830
 minus p for tails.

386
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,359
 Hence, the power of p is

387
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:33,140
 the number of ones in Omega

388
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,580
 and the power of 1 minus

389
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,570
 p is the number of zeros

390
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,260
 in Omega.

391
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,479
 OK.

392
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:40,210
 Now, this probability space

393
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:41,919
 here, you should see as our

394
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:43,510
 abstract one on the left-

395
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,469
 hand side and the right-

396
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,979
 hand side, we only get when

397
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:48,169
 we define a random variable

398
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,669
 X and this

399
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,030
 one should be defined as

400
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,780
 counting the number of heads.

401
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:55,119
 So without order.

402
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:57,219
 In other words, when we use

403
00:10:57,229 --> 00:10:58,950
 numbers, X of Omega

404
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,260
 should be defined as the

405
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,719
 number of ones in

406
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:02,340
 Omega.

407
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,369
 Now, if you want, you can

408
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,309
 rewatch part four where

409
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,880
 we already explained this

410
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,210
 random experiment here.

411
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,489
 Then it might not surprise

412
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,849
 you that the distribution

413
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,510
 of X is given by the

414
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,909
 binomial distribution.

415
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:18,369
 Indeed, if you do the explicit

416
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,200
 calculation for P_X,

417
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,469
 you see this

418
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:22,690
 coincides with the

419
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,640
 explanations we gave in part

420
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,049
 four.

421
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,580
 Hence, here you see this

422
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,260
 is a good example, where the

423
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,919
 actual random experiment

424
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:32,500
 we are interested in is

425
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,169
 hidden in a random variable

426
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,500
 and you will see, this will

427
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,039
 happen a lot in future.

428
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,219
 OK.

429
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:40,440
 Then in the next videos,

430
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,200
 we will continue our journey

431
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,780
 in probability theory.

432
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:45,359
 Therefore, I hope I see you

433
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:46,739
 there and have a nice day.

434
00:11:46,849 --> 00:11:47,650
 Bye.
