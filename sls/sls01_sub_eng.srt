00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:05,400
hello and welcome to start learning sets

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,799
a video course where I give you a quick

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,200
introduction into set theory

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,420
however first many many thanks to all

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,940
the nice people on Steady or PayPal who

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,340
make these videos possible now for

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,140
learning mathematics set theory is so

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,480
important because you can describe

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,420
everything in mathematics using just

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,939
sets indeed you could see the field of

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,160
logic together with the set theory as

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,619
the foundation of mathematics

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,260
this works as follows in the language of

14
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,200
logic we describe the axioms we want the

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,480
axioms of set theory this means that we

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,440
have a list of propositions assumed to

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,660
be true

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,399
then that's our starting point we have

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,020
to start somewhere we have to put

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,660
something in first

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,360
and all the things we logically get out

22
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,879
form our world of mathematics

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,739
in this way we then reach our goal we

24
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,680
can do mathematics

25
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,780
however this path is way too long and

26
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,879
needs a lot of time such that you should

27
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,640
never do that at the beginning of your

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,680
mathematical career thankfully there is

29
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,720
a very nice shortcut that works so good

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,500
that you can do a lot of mathematics

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,240
without bothering about the axioms on

32
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,760
this path we just learned a little bit

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,460
of propositional logic and something we

34
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,320
call naive set theory okay the name

35
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,540
seems a little bit strange we will just

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,460
call it set theory and indeed the only

37
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,080
difference is that we don't write down

38
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,420
all the axioms

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,240
with this and the propositional logic we

40
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,220
learned in the last videos we can go to

41
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,500
doing mathematics

42
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,140
Now by having this picture in mind let's

43
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,659
go to the start of set theory

44
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,500
so let's start by saying what

45
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,840
a set is.

46
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,479
one often says a set is just a

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,360
collection of distinct objects into a

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,799
whole. So the idea would be if we have

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,140
some objects

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,840
for example here four different objects

51
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,159
then the set puts them all together into

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,020
a collection

53
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,479
there see this is not a correct

54
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,399
definition it's just the idea we have in

55
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,500
mind written down

56
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,599
hence it means that by putting the

57
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,900
objects together we get out a new thing

58
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,420
we could call here the set M so what

59
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,220
makes the set M are the objects so we

60
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,080
have a natural relation between the

61
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,060
objects and the set

62
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,239
now in order to make everything easier

63
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,360
we call such an object x inside a set M

64
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,420
just an element of M

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,379
or even better we use a short formula

66
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,560
for this

67
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:37,080
so we use this special e for element and

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,879
read it as X in m

69
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,640
so for the example on the right hand

70
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,500
side we would write the circle with A is

71
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,440
an element of M

72
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,480
moreover If x is not such an object of

73
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,239
the collection we write a similar thing

74
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,519
x is not an element in M

75
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,420
there we would use the line through the

76
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,340
e

77
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,459
now on the right hand side for the

78
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,260
example we would write this D is not an

79
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,300
element in M

80
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,940
now at this point because you know some

81
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,400
logic I can say that this new notation

82
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,440
is just a short notation for the

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,239
negation of this statement

84
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,360
there you have it we see the element

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,180
relations as logical statements

86
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,879
and because a set is defined by these

87
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,340
element relations we can just define a

88
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,739
set by giving all the elements

89
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,959
for this one usually uses the curly

90
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,180
brackets as we did before

91
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,620
so this is a set that has the number two

92
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:37,080
the number 5 and the number 6 as elements

93
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,959
so inside the curly brackets we have a

94
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,940
list of all the elements and please note

95
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,799
the order does not matter because we

96
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,780
only need the element relation so

97
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,819
there's no order inside the set

98
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,280
now another useful notation we can

99
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:53,519
introduce now is when I want to give the

100
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,580
set a new name for example A. Then I

101
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,440
would write colon equality

102
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,260
and we would read that the left hand

103
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,000
side is defined by the right hand side

104
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,220
so it's an assignment which should

105
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,860
remind you that the new name a new

106
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,319
variable is introduced at this point

107
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,540
okay now before we go into the details

108
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,780
of set theory I first want to show you

109
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:18,120
some examples of sets that we use later

110
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,359
the first one is the empty set which is

111
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,759
the unique set that has no elements at all

112
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,220
and the notation we use is just a circle

113
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,740
with a line through it

114
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,300
however other people just use the empty

115
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,400
curly brackets

116
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,979
now the following number sets we will

117
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,320
define later correctly but here I can

118
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:38,400
already show you the symbols we use for

119
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,860
them

120
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,500
for the natural numbers starting with 1

121
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,080
we use the N as a symbol

122
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:50,340
and for the natural numbers including 0

123
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,380
I use the same N with an index 0. Ff we

124
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,540
include the negative numbers as well we

125
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,520
call them the integers and denote them

126
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,860
by capital Z

127
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,020
in later videos we will properly define

128
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,060
these sets but for the moment it's a

129
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,500
good thing that we have the number sets

130
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,759
such that we can write down some

131
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,680
examples

132
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,479
therefore I assume that you already know

133
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,800
at least some things about natural

134
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,080
numbers

135
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,940
now later when we are ready for it we

136
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,600
can also Define the rational numbers

137
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:22,620
denoted by Q the real numbers denoted by

138
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,900
R and the complex numbers denoted by C

139
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,780
okay now the natural question for you

140
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,539
would be how can we define sets without

141
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,880
writing down all the elements

142
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,440
for example for the natural numbers you

143
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,580
already see the problem with this

144
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,280
approach

145
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,759
now in order to efficiently do this we

146
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,380
have to go back to logic and talk about

147
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,360
quantifiers and predicates

148
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,580
indeed I already mentioned what a predicate

149
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,400
is it's something with a variable

150
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:53,580
for example x and it becomes a logical

151
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,220
statement if we set a value for x

152
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,320
therefore x in N would be a nice

153
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,720
example of a predicate

154
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,900
and quantifiers are just reversed

155
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,000
letters A and E and we will talk about

156
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,460
them in the next video

157
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,310
okay I hope I see you there and have a

158
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:28,589
nice day bye

159
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:28,589
