00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,440
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,000
 real analysis.

3
00:00:04,489 --> 00:00:05,679
 And first, I want to thank

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,739
 all the nice people that

5
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,199
 support this channel on Steady 

6
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:08,960
 or paypal.

7
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,489
 Now, in today's part 49 we

8
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,029
 will continue talking about

9
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:14,369
 the Riemann integral.

10
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:16,920
 In particular, we will show

11
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,350
 that the integral for step

12
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,079
 functions is well defined

13
00:00:20,889 --> 00:00:21,389
 for this.

14
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:23,360
 Please recall as step function

15
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,149
 phi is defined on a compact

16
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:26,850
 interval and it is piece-

17
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,909
 wisely constant.

18
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,250
 So a typical graph looks

19
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:30,979
 like this.

20
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,598
 So we have constant parts

21
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,060
 and some jumps involved.

22
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:36,299
 Therefore, the important

23
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,610
 thing for us is that we can

24
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:39,400
 choose a partition for the

25
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:40,639
 interval A B,

26
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:42,840
 the explicit definition of

27
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:44,139
 a partition I gave you in

28
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,549
 the last video here.

29
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,439
 Please recall it's a finite

30
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,750
 set where the elements are

31
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,500
 called X with an index.

32
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:52,819
 Now corresponding to such

33
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,650
 a partition, we can also choose

34
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:56,400
 numbers, we call C one C

35
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:57,439
 two and so on.

36
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:59,490
 And these are simply the

37
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,290
 important values the function

38
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,400
 phi can have.

39
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:03,610
 OK.

40
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:05,138
 Then with this, we can

41
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,739
 define the integral for the

42
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,139
 step function phi

43
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,139
 we just calculate the

44
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,599
 orientated area of a

45
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,459
 rectangle here and sum them

46
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,389
 up and then

47
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,169
 this finite sum is just

48
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,169
 called the integral of Phi

49
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:21,209
 denote it with this

50
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:21,730
 symbol.

51
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,389
 Now, the topic for this video

52
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,069
 is this proposition here

53
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,410
 and it tells us that this

54
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:29,849
 symbol here is well

55
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,400
 defined more

56
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,919
 precisely, this means no

57
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,209
 matter which partition we

58
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,050
 choose with this property,

59
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,809
 we still get out the same

60
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:38,330
 number.

61
00:01:39,029 --> 00:01:40,129
 You see this because on the

62
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:41,500
 left hand side, we don't

63
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,910
 mention the partition at all.

64
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,180
 Therefore, in the proof,

65
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,540
 we just have to consider

66
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,059
 two arbitrarily chosen

67
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,849
 partitions.

68
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:51,029
 So let's call the first one,

69
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,839
 P one and the second

70
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:53,959
 one, P two.

71
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:56,260
 So for P one, let's call

72
00:01:56,269 --> 00:01:57,930
 the partition X zero X one

73
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,529
 and so on until we reach

74
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,010
 the last point XN.

75
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:03,440
 Of course, for P two, we

76
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:04,860
 need different symbols.

77
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,199
 Therefore, I would suggest

78
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,119
 we take X to the zero.

79
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,399
 Otherwise it should look

80
00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:10,958
 the same.

81
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:12,539
 So we have X to the one X

82
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:13,958
 to the two and so on, but

83
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,248
 the size could be different.

84
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:16,718
 So let's call it m.

85
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,039
 In other words, the number

86
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,669
 of elements in the two partitions

87
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:21,690
 could be different

88
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:22,990
 here.

89
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,839
 Please recall the whole thing

90
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,029
 is a decomposition of the

91
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,639
 X axis.

92
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:28,639
 So for example, P one, you

93
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,000
 could visualize like this.

94
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,339
 On the other hand, P two,

95
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,740
 you could visualize in the

96
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,710
 same way it could look completely

97
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,630
 differently.

98
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,119
 But of course, it could also

99
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,179
 look similarly

100
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:41,589
 and maybe the first case

101
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,070
 we should consider would

102
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,529
 be that they are very

103
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,139
 similar.

104
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,539
 However, here, please don't

105
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,380
 forget both partitions should

106
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:50,770
 work for our chosen step

107
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:51,660
 function Phi

108
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,690
 for the first one, we call

109
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:55,020
 the value CJ.

110
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,979
 And for the second one, maybe

111
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,699
 DJ.

112
00:02:58,589 --> 00:03:00,000
 Of course, in some sense,

113
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,259
 the values should be the

114
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,910
 same.

115
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:03,850
 But in general, the indices

116
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,089
 don't coincide.

117
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:07,070
 The important thing you should

118
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,309
 remember here is that the

119
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,009
 step function phi is

120
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,949
 always the same.

121
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:13,240
 For example, the craft could

122
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,089
 look like this.

123
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:17,100
 And then you see one possibility

124
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,339
 for a partition would be

125
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,130
 X one and X two here.

126
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,460
 However, of course, you can

127
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,740
 also think of other

128
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,399
 possibilities for a partition.

129
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,559
 So maybe here on the right

130
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,529
 hand side, you just see more

131
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:31,190
 points on the X axis.

132
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,279
 We still have points at the

133
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:34,419
 jump points here.

134
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:35,750
 But otherwise we have more

135
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,199
 points.

136
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,830
 So it's a finer partition

137
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,160
 than on the left hand side.

138
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:41,639
 But otherwise this property

139
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:43,089
 here that is important is

140
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,970
 still fulfilled.

141
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,279
 OK.

142
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:47,080
 As promised, this is exactly

143
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:48,399
 the first case we want to

144
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:48,860
 consider.

145
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:50,320
 Now more

146
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,000
 precisely it means that partition

147
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:53,610
 two just adds more

148
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:55,080
 points to partition one.

149
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,750
 This means as a set P

150
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,539
 two is a super set of P

151
00:03:59,550 --> 00:03:59,979
 one.

152
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,889
 In words, we would say partition

153
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:04,500
 two is finer than

154
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:05,419
 partition one.

155
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:07,820
 What this means in the picture

156
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,630
 you can see above because

157
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,570
 X one is exactly

158
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,410
 the same point as X tilde

159
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,050
 three.

160
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:16,760
 Moreover X two is

161
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,230
 the same point as X two,

162
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,029
 the five.

163
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,119
 Now on the left hand side,

164
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,649
 there is no point between

165
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,329
 the two.

166
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,760
 But on the right hand side,

167
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:26,220
 we find an additional one.

168
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:27,649
 OK?

169
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,890
 Maybe it's a good idea to

170
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:30,679
 use exactly this example

171
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,179
 to explain the general concept

172
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:32,480
 here.

173
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:34,489
 Hence, we can write this

174
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,480
 equalities and

175
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:37,209
 inequalities where we have

176
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,079
 X one is equal to X to the

177
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:40,989
 three and X to the five is

178
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,109
 equal to X two.

179
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,540
 And in the middle, we still

180
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:46,170
 find X to the four.

181
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,410
 Now, going back to the picture

182
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,730
 on the left hand side, we

183
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:51,190
 have our value, we would

184
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,359
 call C two

185
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:54,720
 because this is the value

186
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,359
 of the second interval here.

187
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,510
 However, on the right hand

188
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,869
 side, this would be D

189
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,640
 four and D

190
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:02,549
 five.

191
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:05,170
 However, the important thing

192
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,950
 is this is still equal to

193
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,519
 C two.

194
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,989
 And of course, this is important

195
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,220
 when we want to calculate

196
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,899
 the area of the corresponding

197
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,750
 rectangles

198
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:15,059
 there.

199
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,470
 Please keep in mind on the

200
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,200
 right hand side, we have

201
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:19,459
 two rectangles.

202
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,589
 So we have to one area on

203
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,059
 the left and the other one

204
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,799
 on the right.

205
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:26,190
 And maybe not so surprising.

206
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,179
 In the end, this should be

207
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,929
 the same area as we find

208
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,160
 it on the left hand side.

209
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,220
 However, the important thing

210
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,109
 for us here is this comes

211
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,510
 out of the calculation,

212
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,660
 namely on the right hand

213
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,299
 side, the first rectangle

214
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:41,160
 is the four times the

215
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,380
 length of the interval

216
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,100
 which is X to the four

217
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:46,549
 minus X to the

218
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:47,220
 three

219
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,839
 plus the second rectangle,

220
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,320
 which is the five

221
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:53,040
 times the length of the interval.

222
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,619
 And this one here is X to

223
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,410
 the five minus X to the

224
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:57,850
 four.

225
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,200
 And now I see because the

226
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:01,660
 four and the five are the

227
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,450
 same, we can factor it

228
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:05,440
 out, then we

229
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,940
 can just call it C two

230
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,500
 because it's the same value.

231
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:10,880
 And now we put all the X

232
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,839
 tilde into the parentheses

233
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:14,440
 and then you see X tilde

234
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,059
 four will cancel out.

235
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:18,760
 Moreover, we also know

236
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:20,250
 X 25 is

237
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,519
 exactly X two.

238
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,730
 So we can substitute this

239
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:24,519
 immediately.

240
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,769
 And the same we can do for

241
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:28,619
 X to the three which is X

242
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,019
 one.

243
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:31,510
 Hence, we find this whole

244
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,149
 thing here is X two

245
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,929
 times X two minus

246
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,799
 X one which

247
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:38,609
 is as you know the area

248
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:40,109
 here on the left hand side.

249
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,619
 OK.

250
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,980
 Now with this calculation,

251
00:06:42,989 --> 00:06:44,779
 you should see this works

252
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,579
 exactly the same for all

253
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:47,540
 other points here.

254
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,859
 In other words, splitting

255
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:51,540
 up the rectangle into more

256
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:53,130
 rectangles here does not

257
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,220
 change the area.

258
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,209
 Therefore, also summing up

259
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,109
 all rectangles gives us the

260
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,100
 same result.

261
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,000
 So the left hand side here

262
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,480
 is the area we calculate

263
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,609
 with the first partition.

264
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:05,839
 And on the right hand side,

265
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,640
 you see the area we calculate

266
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:08,720
 with the second partition.

267
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,630
 And by the argument from

268
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,260
 above the sum is the

269
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:12,690
 same.

270
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,609
 And this is what we want

271
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:16,459
 to show that the sum does

272
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,839
 not depend on the choice

273
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,600
 of the partition.

274
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,089
 However, please here keep

275
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,739
 in mind this only worked

276
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,089
 because one partition was

277
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,279
 finer than the other.

278
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,579
 Therefore, the second case

279
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,230
 should be that we don't have

280
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:29,649
 this.

281
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:32,279
 So we don't have this subset

282
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,200
 relation there.

283
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,380
 So P one is not a subset

284
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,179
 of P two

285
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,040
 and of course, also not

286
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:41,459
 the other way around because

287
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,869
 then we would be in the first

288
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,760
 case again, it would just

289
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:46,700
 be renaming the partition.

290
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:49,510
 However, in this case, we

291
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,510
 still can use the first case

292
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,859
 because we could define a

293
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:54,329
 new partition P

294
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:54,869
 three.

295
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,109
 It just needs to include

296
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,589
 all the points of both

297
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,390
 partitions,

298
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,980
 which means we have to union

299
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:03,799
 P one with P two.

300
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:06,690
 Now with this P three is

301
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,589
 clearly a superset of P one

302
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,380
 and P two.

303
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:12,059
 Hence, here in both

304
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,980
 cases, we can use the first

305
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:14,450
 case.

306
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,779
 Therefore, we immediately

307
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,160
 get two results out.

308
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,899
 First we get when we calculate

309
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,399
 this sum for P one.

310
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,260
 So let's write Sigma with

311
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:24,940
 P one.

312
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,399
 Then you know, I just mean

313
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,019
 this sum with the correct

314
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,619
 partition.

315
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:32,000
 Then the first case tells

316
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,630
 us now this is exactly the

317
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,510
 same as calculating the sum

318
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,099
 with the partition three.

319
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,530
 OK.

320
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,330
 And a similar result we get

321
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,210
 when we apply this inclusion

322
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,330
 for the first case

323
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:45,698
 there we get that the sum

324
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:47,578
 using P two is the

325
00:08:47,588 --> 00:08:49,338
 same as the sum using

326
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:50,028
 P three.

327
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,739
 However, of course, the sum

328
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,299
 with P three is always the

329
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:54,869
 same.

330
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:56,729
 So here we see the sum with

331
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:58,530
 P one is exactly the

332
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,250
 same as the sum with P two.

333
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,650
 Hence also here, the

334
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:04,570
 result is the sum

335
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,289
 does not depend on the choice

336
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:07,090
 of the partition.

337
00:09:07,989 --> 00:09:09,409
 And this is exactly what

338
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:10,570
 we wanted to prove.

339
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,450
 The integral symbol is well

340
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,010
 defined.

341
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,409
 OK.

342
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:16,159
 So you see this was a technical

343
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:17,900
 proof but we had to do it.

344
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:20,039
 However, now in the next

345
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:21,440
 video, we can talk about

346
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,020
 the important properties

347
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,630
 the integral has for step

348
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,239
 functions.

349
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:27,349
 Therefore, I hope I see you

350
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,789
 there and have a nice day.

351
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,549
 Bye.
