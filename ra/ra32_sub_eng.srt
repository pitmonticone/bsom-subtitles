00:00:00,349 --> 00:00:02,329
 Hello and welcome to real

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:03,349
 analysis.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,260
 And as always, first, I really

4
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:06,449
 want to thank all the nice

5
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,409
 people that support this

6
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,939
 channel on study or pay pal.

7
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:10,970
 And now in today's part

8
00:00:10,979 --> 00:00:12,630
 32 we will talk about the

9
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,369
 intermediate value theorem

10
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:15,250
 there.

11
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,709
 As before what we will need

12
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,209
 is a continuous function.

13
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:20,079
 F as usual

14
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,170
 we call the domain of the

15
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,170
 function here just by eye.

16
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,850
 However, now

17
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,270
 actually we need an

18
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:26,930
 interval.

19
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:29,340
 So let's write it as A B

20
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,299
 where A and B are included

21
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:32,098
 in the domain.

22
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:33,779
 In this case, we can draw

23
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,450
 a very nice compact picture

24
00:00:35,459 --> 00:00:36,909
 for the graph of the function.

25
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,729
 For example, the grave could

26
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,159
 look like this where we have

27
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:41,970
 the interval A B on the X

28
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:42,299
 axis.

29
00:00:43,139 --> 00:00:44,450
 And now you should see on

30
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:46,200
 the Y axis, we also

31
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:47,259
 find an interval.

32
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,750
 In this case, we find F of

33
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,459
 A at the bottom and F of

34
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,459
 B at the top.

35
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,180
 However, of course, it could

36
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:55,419
 be the other way around.

37
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,590
 Now, the intermediate value

38
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,250
 theorem tells us that for

39
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,919
 all values Y in this

40
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,279
 interval, we find a

41
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,599
 corresponding X.

42
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,160
 So you could say all intermediate

43
00:01:06,169 --> 00:01:07,669
 values are hit by the

44
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,339
 function, the function

45
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:11,029
 simply cannot escape here

46
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,650
 if it starts here and ends

47
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,220
 there because it's

48
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,879
 continuous and it cannot

49
00:01:15,889 --> 00:01:17,139
 make any jumps.

50
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,449
 Therefore, the intermediate

51
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:21,300
 value theorem gives a meaning

52
00:01:21,309 --> 00:01:22,389
 to the sentence that the

53
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,889
 graph of a continuous

54
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,839
 function can be drawn in

55
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:26,680
 one stroke.

56
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:27,510
 OK.

57
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,040
 Then let's formulate this

58
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,230
 nice theorem

59
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,540
 here.

60
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,190
 I can tell you the intermediate

61
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:34,709
 value theorem is one of the

62
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,290
 most important theorems you

63
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,709
 learn in analysis.

64
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,569
 Now what we have to put in,

65
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,339
 we already know we

66
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:42,769
 only need two assumptions.

67
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:44,330
 Firstly, F should be a

68
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:46,330
 continuous function defined

69
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,879
 on the interval A B.

70
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,809
 And secondly, we take any

71
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,589
 number Y on the Y axis in

72
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,080
 this interval.

73
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:53,980
 OK.

74
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,529
 If we want to be precise,

75
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,300
 we write down both intervals.

76
00:01:57,309 --> 00:01:58,389
 The one where we start with

77
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,919
 F of A and the other one

78
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,919
 where we start with F of

79
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,900
 B just depending which

80
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,110
 of the two numbers is the

81
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,059
 smaller one.

82
00:02:05,449 --> 00:02:07,059
 For example, in our picture,

83
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:08,679
 we can set why through this

84
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,300
 point.

85
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,979
 And then the intermediate

86
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,839
 value theorem tells us there

87
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,559
 is a corresponding X, we

88
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,789
 call X tilda.

89
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:17,880
 It's an element of the interval

90
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,690
 A B and it is sent to

91
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:20,960
 Y by F.

92
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,309
 So F of X tilde is

93
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,309
 equal to Y.

94
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,399
 OK.

95
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,820
 So this is the intermediate

96
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,399
 value theorem we'll prove

97
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:28,880
 today.

98
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,639
 But before we do that, I

99
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:32,619
 present you kolo you really

100
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,520
 should remember.

101
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,179
 It tells us that the image

102
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,899
 of the interval A B

103
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,289
 where we denote the image

104
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,360
 with the square pockets as

105
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,179
 well is also an

106
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,899
 interval.

107
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,619
 More concretely it's the

108
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,979
 interval that starts with

109
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,289
 the minimum of the function

110
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,220
 F and goes to the maximum

111
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:50,139
 of the function F.

112
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,070
 Therefore, you see it's the

113
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,440
 same claim as before.

114
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,179
 All the intermediate values

115
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,000
 are also hi.

116
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,070
 OK.

117
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,729
 Then I would say we can start

118
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,440
 with the proof of the intermediate

119
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:01,580
 value theorem.

120
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,990
 In fact, as we will see the

121
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,869
 proof is not so complicated,

122
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:07,910
 the first step will be to

123
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,449
 normalize the problem in

124
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,229
 some sense.

125
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,130
 In order to understand this,

126
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:13,500
 let's visualize the curve

127
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,710
 of a function again,

128
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,029
 this is similar as before

129
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,419
 where now, for example, we

130
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:19,710
 have our Y here.

131
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,669
 Now when I say we want to

132
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,330
 normalize the problem, it

133
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:24,990
 means it would be nice to

134
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,910
 have this Y at zero.

135
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,729
 And of course, we could just

136
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,289
 do that.

137
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,089
 So we take the whole function

138
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:32,710
 and shift it to zero.

139
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,960
 So simply as that we get

140
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,339
 a new function, we could

141
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,229
 call G.

142
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:38,960
 Now, what you should see

143
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,960
 is that the problem for searching

144
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,580
 such next tilde stays

145
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:43,809
 exactly the same.

146
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,250
 But now we search for

147
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:45,910
 zeros.

148
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,470
 In summary, this is our idea,

149
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,899
 we simply define a new

150
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,770
 function G and

151
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:53,630
 this is simply F minus

152
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,830
 the value Y.

153
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:56,880
 Now, the next normalization

154
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,360
 we could do is that it would

155
00:03:58,369 --> 00:04:00,190
 be nice if the value at the

156
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,169
 right is larger than

157
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:03,550
 the value on the left.

158
00:04:04,029 --> 00:04:05,429
 So what we could do is just

159
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,830
 mirror the whole graph.

160
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,339
 And then we have a new

161
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,169
 function which has exactly

162
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:12,169
 this property and

163
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:13,649
 this function we now can

164
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,009
 call F tilde.

165
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,130
 However, please note here,

166
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,890
 we only mirror the graph

167
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,970
 if it's needed.

168
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,890
 So in the formula, this would

169
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,690
 mean F tilde is defined

170
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,089
 as minus G.

171
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,040
 However, only in the case

172
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:28,970
 that G of A is greater than

173
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,570
 zero.

174
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,920
 If G of A is less or equal

175
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:33,109
 than zero, we don't have

176
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:34,130
 to do anything.

177
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,980
 We can just set F tilde to

178
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:36,399
 G.

179
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:37,429
 OK.

180
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,950
 Now let's summarize what

181
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,790
 we have here.

182
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,420
 First F tilda is of

183
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:44,130
 course, still a continuous

184
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,869
 function.

185
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,269
 And our value we search for,

186
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,250
 we could call why tilda is

187
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,429
 just zero.

188
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:52,709
 Moreover, we also know that

189
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,660
 we have a minus sign or zero

190
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,420
 on the left hand side and

191
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,160
 the plus sign or zero on

192
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,179
 the right hand side.

193
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,239
 Therefore, the activity we

194
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,829
 have thrown before is the

195
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,170
 correct example we should

196
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:04,940
 have in mind.

197
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:05,839
 OK.

198
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,399
 Now, the proof that we follow

199
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,760
 will look similar to the

200
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:10,179
 proof we already did for

201
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,019
 the Bolzano Vasta theorem,

202
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,549
 namely we cut the interval

203
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:16,200
 A B in the middle

204
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,739
 and then choose one of the

205
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,760
 two intervals here.

206
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,630
 And after this, this

207
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,920
 projection, we will do

208
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:22,799
 repeatedly.

209
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:24,989
 In conclusion in the end,

210
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,609
 we will get a limit here.

211
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,470
 The only thing we have to

212
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,190
 do in each step is to check

213
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,119
 the value F tilt of C

214
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,489
 if this one is greater than

215
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,089
 zero.

216
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:37,089
 Then our C could be the new

217
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,529
 B.

218
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,779
 In other words, we will choose

219
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,940
 the left interval.

220
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,779
 In this case, in the other

221
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,950
 case, we would choose the

222
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,029
 right interval.

223
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:47,109
 Of course, the overall idea

224
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:48,350
 of this definition is that

225
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:50,149
 we still have the same assumption,

226
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,989
 we still have the sign change

227
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,070
 from left to right.

228
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:55,230
 This means then that nothing

229
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:56,660
 really changes here, we can

230
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,899
 do the same thing again.

231
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,640
 Then of course, we would

232
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:01,529
 define B two and A two.

233
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,880
 Then afterwards we would

234
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,549
 define B three and A three

235
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:05,309
 and so on.

236
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,410
 Therefore, in the end, we

237
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,049
 get two sequences out.

238
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:11,429
 So we have A and BN.

239
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,959
 And by construction, we know

240
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,640
 they are called she sequences.

241
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:16,940
 Moreover, we also know that

242
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,220
 the intervals get smaller

243
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,049
 and smaller.

244
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:20,260
 And indeed, we know that

245
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:22,119
 the length converges to zero,

246
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,790
 hence the completeness axiom

247
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:26,250
 and the limit theorems get

248
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,510
 us to the result that we

249
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,429
 have exactly one limit here.

250
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,149
 Now, you might already know

251
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,570
 this is exactly the point

252
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:34,109
 we want to call X tilda.

253
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,640
 And by construction it's

254
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:37,149
 an element of the interval

255
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,809
 A B.

256
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,890
 Hence the only question that

257
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,649
 remains is what happens with

258
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,359
 X tilda when we put it into

259
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,690
 the function F tilda.

260
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,809
 In order to see this, please

261
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,750
 note that the sign change

262
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,929
 for the function F tilde

263
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,899
 holds for the whole sequence

264
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,329
 A and BN.

265
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:56,019
 Therefore, and by the monotonicity

266
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:57,820
 of the limit, we also know

267
00:06:57,829 --> 00:06:59,279
 that this property still

268
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,839
 holds when we put the limit

269
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,410
 in front.

270
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,339
 And there you see, we can

271
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,970
 use the continuity of the

272
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,760
 function of tilda and push

273
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:07,859
 the limit inside.

274
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,950
 Then you see, it looks like

275
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,670
 this and we can substitute

276
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:13,250
 this limit with X tilde.

277
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:15,790
 So what we get out is a number

278
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:17,790
 F tilt of X tilde which

279
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:19,429
 is less or equal than zero

280
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,720
 and greater or equal than

281
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,220
 zero.

282
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:23,489
 Hence, the only possibility

283
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,100
 is that this number is

284
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:26,399
 exactly zero.

285
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,420
 And there you see indeed

286
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:29,790
 we have solved the problem

287
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,500
 for our function F tilde.

288
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,359
 Also, you should see it's

289
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,839
 not a problem at all to go

290
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,649
 back to our original function

291
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,359
 F because you

292
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:40,200
 immediately see the X tilda

293
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,730
 we found is also a

294
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:43,420
 zero for the function G.

295
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,079
 This simply holds by the

296
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,279
 definition of the function

297
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,079
 F tilde as a flip when we

298
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:48,559
 need it.

299
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,200
 However, the function G was

300
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,910
 defined by F minus

301
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,839
 Y and because this

302
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,220
 is now zero, this

303
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,109
 implies F

304
00:07:58,119 --> 00:07:59,130
 of X tilde is

305
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,779
 indeed Y

306
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:02,570
 and that's exactly what we

307
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:03,359
 wanted to show.

308
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,809
 So the intermediate value

309
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,279
 theorem is proven.

310
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,380
 OK.

311
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,209
 Then I would say please remember

312
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,709
 this important the om and

313
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,980
 then I see you in the next

314
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:12,440
 video.

315
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,820
 Have a nice day and bye.
