00:00:00,389 --> 00:00:02,170
 Hello and welcome to

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,500
 Real Analysis part

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:04,530
 25.

4
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:06,409
 And first, I want to thank

5
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,809
 all the nice supporters on

6
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,170
 Steady or paypal.

7
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:10,800
 In this video.

8
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,180
 Today, we will talk about

9
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:13,930
 the uniform convergence of

10
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:15,359
 a sequence of functions.

11
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,379
 In order to understand this,

12
00:00:17,389 --> 00:00:19,229
 please first recall that

13
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:21,079
 we call a sequence of functions

14
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,850
 pointwisely convergent to

15
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,829
 another function F

16
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,670
 if for all points X tilde,

17
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:28,600
 we have the convergence of

18
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,100
 the values at this point.

19
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,200
 This means that in this

20
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:34,150
 formulation with the quantifiers,

21
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,599
 you are allowed to choose

22
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,450
 different capital NS depending

23
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:38,479
 on X tilde.

24
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:40,759
 And indeed, this is the only

25
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,180
 thing we will change to get

26
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:43,639
 the uniform convergence.

27
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:46,000
 So we call a sequence of

28
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:47,830
 functions uniformly

29
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,000
 convergent to F

30
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:51,240
 if for all epsilon

31
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,150
 greater than zero, there

32
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,110
 exists a capital N such that

33
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,819
 for all indices N

34
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,430
 greater or equal than N

35
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:00,869
 and for all points x tilde

36
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,869
 in I, we have that

37
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,990
 the distance between the

38
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,510
 values is less than

39
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,230
 epsilon.

40
00:01:06,919 --> 00:01:08,699
 So you see this quantifier

41
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:10,699
 from before is pushed to

42
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:12,459
 the right, of course.

43
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,959
 Therefore, this looks similar.

44
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,559
 But now this capital

45
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:17,400
 N works uniformly

46
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,150
 for all points X tilde.

47
00:01:19,669 --> 00:01:20,379
 Of course.

48
00:01:20,389 --> 00:01:22,300
 Therefore, this looks similarly.

49
00:01:22,309 --> 00:01:23,940
 But now this capital N

50
00:01:23,949 --> 00:01:25,839
 here works uniformly

51
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:27,709
 for all points X tilde in

52
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,650
 I that's different from

53
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,519
 before because here you

54
00:01:31,529 --> 00:01:32,860
 could choose capital N

55
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,510
 depending on X tilde.

56
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,180
 So there could be different

57
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,389
 capital Ns here.

58
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:39,110
 However, for the uniform

59
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,870
 convergence, this N here

60
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,760
 has to work for all x tilde

61
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,809
 at the same time.

62
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,290
 And exactly this is the reason

63
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,709
 we call it the uniform

64
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,489
 convergence.

65
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,389
 And please keep in mind this

66
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,220
 new order for the quantifier

67
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,419
 changes a lot.

68
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,489
 Let's visualize that in a

69
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,199
 picture.

70
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:58,069
 So here you see the graph

71
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,709
 of the function F which is

72
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,830
 our limit function.

73
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,139
 Now if you fix one point

74
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,919
 X tilde on the X axis,

75
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,830
 this inequality here tells

76
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:08,830
 us that the, value f_n(x tilde)

77
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,809
 lies somewhere in this

78
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,339
 region.

79
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:13,839
 So we have our epsilon here

80
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,600
 and here.

81
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,139
 However, we also know this

82
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:18,869
 inequality here should hold

83
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,289
 for all X tilde.

84
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,660
 Hence we have to move this

85
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:24,610
 region here through all the

86
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:25,339
 points.

87
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:27,580
 In other words, what we get

88
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:29,130
 is such an epsilon tube

89
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:30,729
 around the graph of the

90
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,639
 function F.

91
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,899
 So the graph of the function

92
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,690
 FN needs to lie

93
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:37,419
 inside this epsilon tube.

94
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,949
 And of course, also the graphs

95
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,690
 of the functions in the sequence

96
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,240
 that come after this capital

97
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,649
 N.

98
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,429
 This is exactly what the

99
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,259
 uniform convergence tells

100
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,669
 us.

101
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,789
 So you immediately see this

102
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,360
 is more than we had for the

103
00:02:51,369 --> 00:02:52,649
 pointwise convergence.

104
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:55,179
 And also this picture tells

105
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,800
 us that it should be possible

106
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,509
 to measure a distance between

107
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,360
 two functions.

108
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,350
 By having this distance.

109
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,869
 You can see that the uniform

110
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,830
 convergence is indeed very

111
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,669
 natural for this,

112
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:07,990
 we first should look at the

113
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,839
 picture again, let's

114
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,699
 take two functions and their

115
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,309
 graphs.

116
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,669
 Now the question is how can

117
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,320
 we measure a suitable distance

118
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,610
 between both functions?

119
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,490
 Or in other words, when would

120
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,860
 you say that the functions

121
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:22,369
 are close to each other?

122
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,250
 Of course, what you already

123
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:25,830
 know is that for each point

124
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,559
 X tilde, we can measure the

125
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,020
 distance of the values.

126
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,130
 So what you have to calculate

127
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:32,839
 is the absolute value as

128
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,529
 before.

129
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,220
 So if we call the point,

130
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:37,220
 just X, we have F of X

131
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:39,039
 minus G of X and then

132
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,080
 the absolute value.

133
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:41,970
 And of course, as before,

134
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:43,399
 we could do that for all

135
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,309
 the points X form the domain

136
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,169
 I there, you see,

137
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:48,960
 we find small distances

138
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,869
 but also larger ones.

139
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:53,050
 And indeed the largest one

140
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:54,710
 we would find if we take

141
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,559
 the maximum of these numbers

142
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:56,929
 here.

143
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,830
 However, because we don't

144
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,410
 know if the maximum really

145
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:02,080
 exists, we should take the

146
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:02,809
 supremum.

147
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:05,320
 Hence this number here tells

148
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,259
 us in fact how close

149
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,460
 the two graphs are.

150
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,350
 So we have a distance measure

151
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,550
 for two functions

152
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,899
 and usually we just call

153
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,419
 it the supremum norm.

154
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,238
 The common short notation

155
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,899
 for this would be two bars

156
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,700
 left and right, and the

157
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,100
 infinity symbol as an

158
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:22,739
 index.

159
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,910
 And then we have F minus

160
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,980
 G inside.

161
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,320
 So this is the supremum norm

162
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:29,899
 of F minus G.

163
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,220
 Now, as promised with this,

164
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,000
 we can rewrite the uniform

165
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,220
 convergence definition.

166
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:37,339
 It simply means that the

167
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,100
 supremum norm gives us a

168
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:40,920
 sequence that goes to zero.

169
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:43,230
 So FN minus the limit

170
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:44,760
 function F measured in the

171
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:46,209
 supremum norm goes to

172
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,799
 zero when N goes to

173
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:48,559
 infinity.

174
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,679
 So we started with a sequence

175
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,619
 of functions.

176
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,279
 But what we got here is an

177
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,760
 ordinary sequence of

178
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:55,470
 numbers.

179
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:57,839
 Therefore, this is also the

180
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,500
 ordinary convergence for

181
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,160
 a sequence of real numbers.

182
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:01,920
 OK.

183
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:03,200
 Now, after all these

184
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:04,829
 definitions, let's look at

185
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,920
 an example.

186
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,929
 So maybe we should take one,

187
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,440
 we already discussed in the

188
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,339
 last video there we had

189
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,779
 some simple functions that

190
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,570
 got steeper and steeper here

191
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:16,149
 until the pointwise limit

192
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,440
 was this function.

193
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,429
 We want to calculate a little

194
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:19,750
 bit.

195
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,959
 Therefore, let's say this

196
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,429
 value here is minus

197
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,190
 one and the one above is

198
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,589
 one.

199
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:26,760
 What we will see now is that

200
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:28,619
 we have the pointwise convergence

201
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,230
 but not the uniform

202
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,000
 convergence.

203
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,790
 Therefore, what we should

204
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,540
 look at is the distance between

205
00:05:34,549 --> 00:05:36,369
 FN and F in the

206
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,269
 supremum norm.

207
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:39,290
 Indeed, this is what we can

208
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:40,750
 immediately calculate when

209
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,970
 we look at the jump.

210
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:44,230
 So here we have the jump

211
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:45,869
 of our limit function F.

212
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:48,190
 Now it does not matter which

213
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,260
 of the functions from our

214
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:50,609
 sequence we choose

215
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:52,459
 because all of them are

216
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,709
 connected from bottom to

217
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,190
 top.

218
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,410
 Hence, you can always just

219
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,880
 take the middle point here

220
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,190
 and measure the distance

221
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,190
 to the limit function,

222
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,649
 which is by our given values

223
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,260
 here, always one.

224
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,130
 Hence, we don't need to calculate

225
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,820
 anything.

226
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:08,640
 We immediately know the supremum

227
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:10,559
 norm is always greater or

228
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,779
 equal than one.

229
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:13,850
 And we don't need anything

230
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:15,549
 more because we immediately

231
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,279
 know we can't have this

232
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,679
 converted to zero

233
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,649
 because this distance does

234
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,290
 not get smaller than one.

235
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,519
 Now, this simple example,

236
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:26,220
 without much calculation

237
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,119
 directly gives us the following

238
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:28,760
 result.

239
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,220
 Having the pointwise convergence

240
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,890
 does not tell us that we

241
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,329
 also have the uniform

242
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:35,089
 convergence.

243
00:06:35,549 --> 00:06:36,890
 However, it's also a nice

244
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,579
 result and not hard to show

245
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,619
 that we have the other implication.

246
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,160
 Hence, the uniform convergence

247
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,839
 is indeed stronger than the

248
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,200
 pointwise convergence.

249
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,100
 And for us, the uniform

250
00:06:48,109 --> 00:06:49,500
 convergence will be very

251
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,250
 important later because it

252
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,029
 conserves nice properties

253
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,920
 of functions.

254
00:06:54,429 --> 00:06:55,829
 For example, it conserves

255
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,480
 continuity we will

256
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:58,480
 define later.

257
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:00,579
 That's something that just

258
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,170
 a pointwise convergence can't

259
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:02,570
 do.

260
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,489
 However, one property you

261
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,420
 already know is the bounded

262
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:07,309
 of functions.

263
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,339
 And the uniform convergence

264
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,839
 also conserves this

265
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,589
 property.

266
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,480
 This means if you have a

267
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:15,380
 sequence of bounded functions

268
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:16,609
 and they converge

269
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:18,299
 uniformly, then the

270
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:20,170
 limit function is also

271
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:20,750
 bounded.

272
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:21,890
 OK.

273
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,309
 All details about these

274
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,000
 properties we will discuss

275
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,290
 in the next videos.

276
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:27,959
 Therefore, I hope I see you

277
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,489
 there and have a nice day.

278
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,359
 Bye.
