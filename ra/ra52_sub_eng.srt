00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,259
 Hello and welcome back

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,140
 to real

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,300
 analysis.

4
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:06,320
 And first, I want to thank

5
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:07,570
 all the nice supporters on

6
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:08,920
 Steady and paypal.

7
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:11,739
 Now, in today's part 52 we

8
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,189
 will talk about examples

9
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:14,630
 for the Riemann integral

10
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:15,670
 for this.

11
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,930
 Let's quickly recall the

12
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,329
 definition for Riemann

13
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:19,809
 integrable functions.

14
00:00:20,659 --> 00:00:22,229
 What we need is a bounded

15
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:23,780
 function defined on the

16
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,469
 compact interval A B.

17
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,600
 And we call this function

18
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:28,989
 we man integral.

19
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,659
 If the upper and the lower

20
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,060
 integral are the same

21
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,509
 there, the lower integral

22
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,110
 is given when we approximate

23
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,639
 the integral with step

24
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,000
 functions from below.

25
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:40,959
 And the upper integral is

26
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,560
 given when we approximate

27
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:44,529
 the integral by step functions

28
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,279
 from above.

29
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:47,599
 Hence, we only get one

30
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,330
 well-defined value here

31
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,130
 which we call the integral

32
00:00:51,139 --> 00:00:52,319
 of the function F.

33
00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:55,049
 Now I can tell you it's possible

34
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,610
 to rewrite this definition

35
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:58,049
 here without using

36
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,229
 supremo and infimum.

37
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:01,979
 In this alternative form,

38
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,279
 you might recognize the

39
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,138
 approximation in a better

40
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,760
 way to get the

41
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:07,220
 idea.

42
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,500
 Let's simply to a

43
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:09,980
 small graph here.

44
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:12,959
 So you see our mission is

45
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,199
 that we approximate this

46
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:16,190
 area here from above

47
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:17,080
 and from below.

48
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:19,550
 Now let's say this here is

49
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:21,459
 a step function phi and

50
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,069
 you see it's an approximation

51
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,779
 form below.

52
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,330
 Also, then you can see

53
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:27,610
 without a problem.

54
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,290
 And even with the same partition

55
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,279
 of the x axis, we can choose

56
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,099
 a step function phi that

57
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,790
 approximates the integral

58
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,639
 from above.

59
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:38,410
 However, the important thing

60
00:01:38,419 --> 00:01:39,900
 I want to show you here is

61
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,639
 that the area between both

62
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,300
 step functions is very

63
00:01:43,309 --> 00:01:44,860
 small even

64
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,389
 better.

65
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,269
 We can make it as small as

66
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:47,959
 we want.

67
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,650
 And exactly this fact is

68
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,480
 what we can use for an equivalent

69
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:53,489
 formulation here.

70
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,750
 Namely for all

71
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,150
 epsilon greater than

72
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,800
 zero,

73
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,709
 we find step functions

74
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,459
 Phi MS

75
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,440
 with the property that the

76
00:02:05,449 --> 00:02:07,360
 one lies below F

77
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,339
 and the other one above F.

78
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,929
 And moreover, we have

79
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,449
 that the difference between

80
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,289
 both integrals here is

81
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,130
 less than the given epsilon

82
00:02:18,149 --> 00:02:18,619
 here.

83
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,509
 Please note we know that

84
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,360
 the integral of Phi is

85
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:23,979
 always bigger than the integral

86
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,740
 of Phi.

87
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,440
 So we don't need an absolute

88
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:28,190
 value here.

89
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,720
 We can just calculate the

90
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:30,479
 difference.

91
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:31,820
 OK.

92
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,460
 Now this description here

93
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:35,179
 makes it a little bit easier

94
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,089
 for us to look at examples.

95
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:39,869
 Therefore, I would say let's

96
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,389
 start with the first one

97
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:43,309
 now and I would like

98
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,539
 to start with a

99
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,770
 counterexample.

100
00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:48,130
 It's the so-called dela

101
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:49,009
 function.

102
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,360
 Indeed, it sounds more

103
00:02:51,369 --> 00:02:52,589
 complicated than it really

104
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,119
 is.

105
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:55,000
 And I would say let's define

106
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,399
 the function on the interval

107
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,369
 01.

108
00:02:58,139 --> 00:02:59,639
 And now the common definition

109
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:01,419
 of the function just considers

110
00:03:01,429 --> 00:03:02,309
 two cases.

111
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,779
 We either get the value

112
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:06,380
 one or zero

113
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:08,220
 depending if the X we

114
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,860
 put in is rational or

115
00:03:09,869 --> 00:03:10,339
 not.

116
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,940
 By using the set names, we

117
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:14,919
 can say it's one when X

118
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:16,889
 comes from Q and it's zero

119
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:18,669
 when X comes not from Q.

120
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:21,339
 Now, at first glance, this

121
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,710
 looks like a very simple

122
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,229
 function.

123
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,800
 So let's tour the graph for

124
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:25,000
 it.

125
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,220
 And there you should immediately

126
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:29,050
 see we have infinitely

127
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:30,559
 many rational points for

128
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,449
 the value one, but also

129
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,910
 infinitely many irrational

130
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,509
 points for the value zero.

131
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,100
 And moreover, we know the

132
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,570
 rational points like

133
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,100
 dance in the real number

134
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,539
 line.

135
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,759
 Please remember this is

136
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,660
 exactly how we constructed

137
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:46,779
 the real number line.

138
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,539
 For this reason, it's very

139
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,160
 hard to draw this graph of

140
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:52,649
 the function correctly

141
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,149
 because you have infinitely

142
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,970
 many jumps no matter how

143
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:57,190
 much you zoom in.

144
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,860
 And there you might already

145
00:03:59,869 --> 00:04:01,839
 see that this function is

146
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,440
 not Riemann integrable.

147
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,740
 You see this when you want

148
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,119
 to choose a step function

149
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,009
 si that lies above

150
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,139
 the graph of f

151
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:13,039
 such a step function then

152
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:14,910
 also lies essentially

153
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,940
 above one.

154
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,850
 This is simply because for

155
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,350
 any segment you choose on

156
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:21,959
 the real number line, you

157
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,839
 always find a rational number.

158
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,670
 Hence the value one is

159
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:28,339
 always included in such an

160
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,019
 interval.

161
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:31,619
 Indeed, the same holds for

162
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,059
 the irrational numbers.

163
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,989
 When we want to choose a

164
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,790
 step function phi from

165
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,790
 below there, the

166
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,429
 step function also has to

167
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,070
 lie essentially below

168
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,709
 zero.

169
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,640
 In summary, you see we have

170
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:46,179
 two properties here that

171
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,010
 hold for all step functions,

172
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,140
 Phi and Phi

173
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,649
 and therefore we have immediately

174
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,200
 an estimate for the two

175
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,320
 integrals here.

176
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,559
 And the conclusion will be,

177
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,200
 we can't push the difference

178
00:04:58,209 --> 00:04:59,160
 below one.

179
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,529
 Of course, the first integral

180
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,209
 will always be greater or

181
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,059
 equal than one and the other

182
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,029
 one always less or equal

183
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,869
 than zero.

184
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,359
 In other words, we cannot

185
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:12,179
 fulfill this property for

186
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,190
 all epsilon.

187
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:16,019
 In fact, this is all we need

188
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,489
 in order to show that the

189
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,269
 deli function is not

190
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,459
 riemann integrable

191
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:21,519
 here.

192
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,000
 Again, in the difference,

193
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,429
 this first part here is

194
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,209
 always greater or equal than

195
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,660
 one.

196
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:29,220
 And the second part without

197
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,950
 a minus sign is always

198
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,709
 less or equal than zero.

199
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,609
 Hence the difference of both

200
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:37,170
 numbers is always

201
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:38,910
 greater or equal than one.

202
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,640
 OK.

203
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:42,420
 There you see this was our

204
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,029
 first counterexample.

205
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,500
 Then next, I would say we

206
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,980
 look at a function that is

207
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:49,859
 actually Riemann integral.

208
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,209
 Of course, for the start,

209
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,929
 let's look at a very simple

210
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,559
 example.

211
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:57,130
 And I guess the identity

212
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,890
 F of X is equal to X

213
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,690
 is a very suitable example.

214
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:02,970
 This is simply because when

215
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,890
 we toward the graph, we immediately

216
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,750
 see what the integral should

217
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,070
 be.

218
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:09,519
 You see the area is given

219
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:11,239
 by this triangle which

220
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,920
 means the area should be

221
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:13,790
 one half,

222
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,630
 it's simply half of the square

223
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,029
 where we have the sides as

224
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,950
 one and one.

225
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:21,480
 However, if we work with

226
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:22,709
 the definition of the Riemann

227
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,519
 integral, what we need to,

228
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:26,239
 we can't use the triangle,

229
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,239
 we need to use rectangles.

230
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,130
 Hence, here we can actually

231
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,019
 see if our approximation

232
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,670
 works.

233
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,029
 OK.

234
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,500
 Now, the question here is

235
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,109
 what is a good step function

236
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:39,220
 we can choose here?

237
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,279
 Now, the one we see in the

238
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,820
 picture has four

239
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:44,380
 steps, the

240
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,890
 first height here is

241
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:47,880
 zero, then we go up one

242
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,690
 quarter, then the next quarter,

243
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,239
 the next quarter and then

244
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,010
 it's the end.

245
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:53,970
 Hence, we have our four

246
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,320
 values 0,

247
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:57,160
 1/4 2/4 and

248
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,160
 3/4.

249
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,769
 Also, it's not hard to see

250
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:02,440
 that we split the X axis

251
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,299
 also in four equal

252
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:04,869
 parts.

253
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:07,010
 So we have to interval 0

254
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:08,640
 to 1 quarter, one quarter

255
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:10,529
 to two quarters and so on.

256
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:11,619
 OK.

257
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,079
 So you see this is a well

258
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,320
 defined step function.

259
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:16,119
 You can choose for the approximation

260
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,769
 from below.

261
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:19,239
 It has exactly four

262
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,570
 equidistant steps.

263
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:22,230
 Therefore, let's put a four

264
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:23,429
 into the index here.

265
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,799
 Of course, this tells you

266
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:27,440
 now that the approximation

267
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,329
 will get better when we choose

268
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:31,149
 similarly a step function

269
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,309
 with more steps.

270
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:34,609
 In fact, this is exactly

271
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:35,640
 what we will do.

272
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:37,350
 But now for an arbitrary

273
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:38,329
 integer N,

274
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,029
 hence we have exactly N

275
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,670
 steps now, which means the

276
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:43,720
 denominator here.

277
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,510
 And here is now N

278
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,850
 however, now, instead of

279
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:49,820
 writing in different cases,

280
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:51,630
 I want to put all of them

281
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,350
 into one closed formula.

282
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,660
 And this is what we can do

283
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,399
 with another index K.

284
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,239
 So you should see when K

285
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,190
 is equal to one, we are in

286
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,230
 the first case

287
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,269
 K is equal to two, gives

288
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,269
 us the next case and so on

289
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,829
 until K is equal to

290
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,690
 N gives us the last case

291
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,079
 here.

292
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:13,369
 Hence, the only thing missing

293
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,600
 here is now the value at

294
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:16,380
 the position which is K

295
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,489
 minus one,

296
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,079
 which definitely fits because

297
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:21,859
 it's zero in the first case

298
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,299
 one, in the second case and

299
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:23,730
 so on.

300
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:25,209
 OK.

301
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,640
 So this is a step function

302
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:27,859
 that looks like this.

303
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,619
 But now with N steps,

304
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:31,910
 OK, maybe it's not so

305
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,840
 precise because here

306
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:35,369
 we should have chosen an

307
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,520
 open interval.

308
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,198
 However, then you see it

309
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:40,558
 will clash with the last

310
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:41,299
 case here.

311
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:43,679
 However, we can ignore all

312
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:45,078
 of that because you already

313
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:46,648
 know for the integral, the

314
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:48,018
 boundary points here don't

315
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,158
 make any difference.

316
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,320
 Speaking of the integral,

317
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,260
 maybe let's immediately calculate

318
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,979
 the integral of phi N.

319
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,739
 Now, as we have learned before,

320
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,359
 the integral of a step function

321
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:01,349
 is always the sum of

322
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:02,570
 the areas of the

323
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,510
 rectangles,

324
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:06,340
 please recall we have N

325
00:09:06,349 --> 00:09:07,159
 steps.

326
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:08,580
 Therefore, we have N

327
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,630
 rectangles.

328
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,580
 Honestly, the first one has

329
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,669
 area zero.

330
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,210
 So we could ignore it, but

331
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:15,979
 we can include it nevertheless.

332
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,460
 So now the area of one

333
00:09:18,469 --> 00:09:20,150
 rectangle is simply the

334
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,099
 height times the width.

335
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,280
 And by construction, this

336
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:26,030
 is for all our rectangles

337
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:26,909
 one over and

338
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,729
 you see we have one over

339
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:31,580
 N squared which we can pull

340
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,659
 out of the sum.

341
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,900
 And then you see the only

342
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:36,039
 thing we have to calculate

343
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:37,979
 now is the sum of

344
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:39,619
 the first N minus one

345
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,440
 integers.

346
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,070
 And then we can use something

347
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,669
 some people call the little

348
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,750
 Gauss formula.

349
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,369
 In this case here, it's N

350
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,869
 times N minus

351
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,690
 one divided by

352
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,090
 two.

353
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,119
 In the next step, you see,

354
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,729
 we can simplify this

355
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:57,530
 into one half

356
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:59,530
 minus one divided by

357
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:00,359
 two N.

358
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,820
 OK.

359
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,619
 So this is our result here,

360
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,539
 the result of this integral.

361
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,349
 And what you should immediately

362
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:09,289
 see is that if our approximation

363
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:10,510
 gets better and better.

364
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,770
 So if we send N to

365
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,630
 infinity, the result is

366
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,489
 one half.

367
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,080
 However, that's not enough

368
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,289
 for showing that F is we

369
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:20,049
 are integral because we

370
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:21,750
 also have to approximate

371
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,119
 the integral from above.

372
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,169
 And of course, this is now

373
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:26,809
 what we do with a similar

374
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,659
 step functions.

375
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,590
 I here I would say

376
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:31,159
 let's use the same picture

377
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:33,080
 as before to sketch the

378
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,200
 new step function.

379
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,250
 Of course, it should be the

380
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,880
 same staircase as before

381
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,510
 but now shifted above the

382
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,000
 function.

383
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:42,070
 Therefore, the definition

384
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,750
 of PN should look

385
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,489
 more or less the same as

386
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,630
 the definition of phi.

387
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,030
 Of course, the partition

388
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,479
 of the X axis should be the

389
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:50,969
 same.

390
00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:52,429
 We only have to shift the

391
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,419
 values indeed,

392
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:56,280
 instead of K minus one, we

393
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,669
 now can choose K.

394
00:10:58,469 --> 00:10:59,919
 So you see it's not hard

395
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:01,599
 at all to define such a step

396
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:02,049
 function.

397
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,169
 And indeed in the same way

398
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:06,049
 as before, we can calculate

399
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:06,900
 the integral

400
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,080
 again, it's just a step

401
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:09,760
 function.

402
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,450
 So we add up all the

403
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,500
 areas of the

404
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,489
 rectangles.

405
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,820
 And now the only difference

406
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,700
 from before is that the height

407
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,669
 of the rectangles is slightly

408
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,260
 larger.

409
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:22,809
 Still here, we can pull the

410
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,359
 fact of one over N squared

411
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:25,559
 out of the sum.

412
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,190
 And the only thing that remains

413
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,820
 is the sum of the first and

414
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,679
 numbers, this

415
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,979
 means that we can apply the

416
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:33,859
 same formula as before.

417
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,669
 But now we have one additional

418
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,890
 number at the end.

419
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:38,859
 For this reason, this sum

420
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:40,700
 is then given as N times

421
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,690
 N plus one divided by two.

422
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:43,940
 OK.

423
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,010
 And then in the last step,

424
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,690
 we can simplify this again

425
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,340
 and we get one half

426
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:49,320
 plus

427
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,729
 1/2 N.

428
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,390
 So with this, you should

429
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,250
 see we've reached our goal

430
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:57,590
 because the difference between

431
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:59,380
 these two integrals is

432
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,119
 exactly one

433
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,309
 divided by N.

434
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:04,940
 In other words, we can make

435
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,599
 the difference as small as

436
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:07,260
 we want.

437
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,979
 So if you recall the epsilon

438
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:11,710
 criterion from above, then

439
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,530
 you see that this function

440
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:15,000
 F is Riemann integrable.

441
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,690
 And of course, this is our

442
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,570
 result here.

443
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,099
 Moreover, we also get the

444
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:22,479
 value of the integral of

445
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:24,440
 F which is one half

446
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:26,549
 of course, not a surprise

447
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,150
 for you.

448
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,830
 But now we have proven it.

449
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:30,200
 OK.

450
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,169
 I think that's good enough

451
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:32,859
 for a first example here

452
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:34,719
 we will consider more complicated

453
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:35,869
 examples later.

454
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,830
 Therefore, I hope that I

455
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,070
 see you in the next video

456
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,590
 when we continue with the

457
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:41,630
 Rayman integral.

458
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:44,169
 Have a nice day and bye.
