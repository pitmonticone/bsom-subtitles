00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,500
Hello and welcome back to real analysis

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,700
and as always I want to thank all the nice people, that support this channel on Steady or PayPal

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,400
Now, today we actually start with our analysis course

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,000
by talking about talking about sequences and limits.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Therefore let's immediately start defining what a sequence is.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,000
More concretely we will say that we have a sequence of real numbers,

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,190
when we have a map from the natural numbers into "R".

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,090
and most of the time such a map gets the name "a"

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,700
In the same way also a map "a" from "N0" into "R"

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,900
is called a sequence.

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,100
Please recall. Here in the natural numbers we don't include 0,

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,300
but here in "N0" we do.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,400
So you see, the choice here just depends

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,400
if you want to start counting with 1 or with 0.

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,600
Now, when we deal with sequences we seldom write down such a map,

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,480
but rather an  infinite list of numbers.

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,350
In other words when we put 1 into the function here we get "a1".

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,099
and we put the 1 in the index.

19
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,290
and then we get a2, a3 and so on.

20
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,280
Therefore please remember.

21
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:15,000
Formally a sequence is a map, but we will use shorter notations.

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,200
For example what you often will see is just "(an)".

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,590
and then to remind you that it is an infinite list

24
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,590
we put "n in N" in the index here.

25
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,000
Of course if we want to start with 0 here we will put "N0" in the index here.

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,150
Alternatively, we could also put the starting number here as n=1

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,600
and then remind us again it's an infinite list,

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,600
so we put infinity at the top.

29
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,080
Now if from the context the starting number is clear

30
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,200
we can just omit everything and just use the parentheses.

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,200
Ok. I think that is enough about the notations.

32
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,590
Let's immediately look at some examples.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,970
The best way to describe a sequence is just to give a rule

34
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,200
for all the sequence members "an"

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,000
For example we could say that "an" = -1 to the power n.

36
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,400
and then we can use the parentheses to denote the whole sequence.

37
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,400
So here you see, this is a very simple sequence,

38
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,500
because you see the first number is just -1

39
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,890
and then the next is 1

40
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,100
then -1 again and 1 again and so on.

41
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,000
Therefore if you want to visualize this on the number line

42
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,150
we would start at -1

43
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,640
and then in the next step we jump to 1.

44
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,700
Afterwards for the next step we jump back to -1.

45
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,000
and then we know we continue this whole procedure with no end.

46
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,050
Here you can remember

47
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,460
This is always a good way to visualize a sequence on the number line.

48
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,790
So you can see the sequence has time steps

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,200
where we hit at each timestep a number on the number line.

50
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,880
However this is not the only way to visualize a sequence

51
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,970
because we already know it's simply a map.

52
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,800
Therefore you could also just draw the graph of this map.

53
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,080
In other words we have a set in this coordinate system,

54
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,770
but please remember we have as the domain just the natural numbers,

55
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,150
but the codomain is the real numbers.

56
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,020
Therefore on the y-axis we find "R".

57
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,990
In conclusion we don't get a line in this plane. We just get points.

58
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,030
For example for 1 we find -1. So a point here.

59
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,420
Now this is very important. We have -1 as the value of this map.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,329
In the same way we have 1 as a value when we put 2 into the map.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,500
and then we can continue with 3, 4, 5 and so on.

62
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,380
Now. The jumping we had before we now see here when we go to the right.

63
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,680
Indeed we are very interested in what happens with the values of this sequence

64
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,380
when we just continue here on the line.

65
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,770
Roughly speaking what happens to the sequence when n goes to infinity?

66
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,200
For this example you see not so much will happen,

67
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,200
because we still jump between -1 and 1.

68
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,530
It doesn't matter how large our n is.

69
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,620
The jumping is always the same.

70
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,300
For this reason lets look at another example.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,550
Here our sequence should be defined by the rule "1 over n".

72
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,390
Now you immediately see this is way more interesting,

73
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
because we get out different numbers.

74
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,000
The first number is just 1, but then we have 1/2 then 1/3

75
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,870
and then a lot of different fractions,

76
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,920
because the denominator gets larger and larger.

77
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,000
Now also this sequences we can visualize as a graph.

78
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,750
There we just start with the value 1.

79
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:56,750
Then the value 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 and so on.

80
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,000
Here in fact something happens when we get larger and larger,

81
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,700
because you see, we get closer and closer to 0.

82
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,900
and this is what we will define soon as the limit of the sequence.

83
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,500
So here we recognize that this sequence has such a nice property,

84
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,700
but the sequence from before doesn't satisfy such a rule.

85
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,230
However, before we define the limit as a property of a sequence

86
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,260
lets look at another example.

87
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,730
Here I want to have the numbers that are given by the powers of 2.

88
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:35,000
In other words we have 2, 4, 8, 16 and so on.

89
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,300
Of course this is a very nice sequence,

90
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,130
but now we want to look what happens again when we increase n

91
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,050
so make it larger and larger.

92
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,170
Then you see, the values we get out also get larger and larger.

93
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,240
and indeed, there is no upper bound for the members in the sequence

94
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,350
so we could say, that this limit should be infinity.

95
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,100
But of course we don't know what this means exactly

96
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,400
so we have to clarify this as well.

97
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,350
In order to do this, lets jump to our next definition.

98
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,700
Here we will define the notion of a convergent sequence of real numbers.

99
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,750
We say that a sequence "an" is convergent to a given number  "a"

100
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,200
if the sequence members "an" lie arbitrary close to "a" eventually.

101
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,990
Now before we give the formal definition

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,450
let's visualize this idea on the number line.

103
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,660
So here we have the point "a"

104
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,670
and in green we have the epsilon-neighbourhood of "a".

105
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,100
This means for a given positive number epsilon

106
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,000
we can look at the number "a + epsilon" and "a - epsilon".

107
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,650
and the whole region in green we call the "epsilon neighbourhood of a"

108
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,600
Please note here that "a" doesn't denote the sequence anymore,

109
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,000
but just another number.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,600
This is just a common notation.

111
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,460
Now if we want to have "a" as the limit of the sequence in some sense

112
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,050
we really need to get closer and closer to "a" with the sequence members.

113
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,300
Or in other words eventually

114
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,000
all the sequence members have to lie in this epsilon-neighbourhood of a.

115
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,450
Only finitely many can lie outside.

116
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,500
For example here we could have "a1"

117
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,000
and there "a2",

118
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:22,640
but at some point we will find an index "N" such that

119
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:27,100
all the sequence members afterwards lie inside the epsilon-neighbourhood.

120
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,600
So what you should see is that this is really needed

121
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,980
if we want to make sense out of the sentence

122
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,990
"an" gets closer and closer to the point "a".

123
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,130
Therefore formally we now would say

124
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:46,040
There exits a "N" such that for all "n >= N"

125
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,500
we have that the distance "an" to "a" is less than epsilon.

126
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,400
and this distance we can measure with the absolute value.

127
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,900
Please note. This means exactly the same as saying

128
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,620
"an" lies in the epsilon-neighbourhood of a.

129
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
However here you should see,

130
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,070
this only describes the convergence to the point "a" if this works for any epsilon.

131
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,580
So no matter of small the epsilon is this always works.

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,300
Of course if we choose a smaller epsilon

133
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,850
we may have to choose a bigger "N" here.

134
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,000
In the end this doesn't matter,

135
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:27,020
because we still have infinitely many sequence members inside the epsilon-neighbourhood

136
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,220
and only finitely many outside.

137
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,679
and with this you have the full definition of convergence.

138
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,100
Now the opposite of this we simply call divergence.

139
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,900
So in the case we don't find such a limit point "a" with the property above.

140
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,100
We call the sequence divergent.

141
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,650
We have already seen 2 examples,

142
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,800
where it's very obvious that we can't find such an "a".

143
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,000
But of course you really should write down a correct  proof for this.

144
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,990
However maybe it's more interesting to first look at our positive example.

145
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,500
Or in other words. The sequence 1/n is convergent to 0.

146
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,050
So our "a" from above is now just 0.

147
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,400
We have already talked about this. Intuitively this makes sense.

148
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,870
But now we are able to write down the formal proof of this statement.

149
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:23,000
First you should note, since we have to show this statement for all epsilon

150
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,010
we have to choose an arbitrary epsilon at the beginning.

151
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Therefore the first sentence should read

152
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,500
Let epsilon be a real number that is greater than 0.

153
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,990
and we also already know what the last sentence of the proof should be.

154
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:43,500
Namely that we have that the distance "an" to 0 in this case is less than epsilon.

155
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:49,500
and this should hold for all indices "n >= N".

156
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,940
Hence you see, the only thing that is missing here is the definition of "N"

157
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,880
and the calculation to reach this result.

158
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,260
Of course here we can already fill in some details,

159
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,570
because we know the sequence "an".

160
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,130
First subtracting 0 doesn't change anything

161
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,540
so we have the absolute value of "an".

162
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,150
Which is of course simply 1/n.

163
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,630
Now at this point you should see,

164
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:20,640
because we have this inequality we have the other inequality for the reciprocals

165
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:26,330
Or simply "1/n" is less or equal than "1/N".

166
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,520
Ok. Now with this we have filled in the calculation

167
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,150
and now the only thing missing is that 1/N is indeed less than epsilon.

168
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:40,750
Of course we can define "N" as we want so lets choose it so large that

169
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,400
that "N" times epsilon is greater than 1.

170
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,080
Hence you only have to ask yourself "is this really possible".

171
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,480
and the answer is yes.

172
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,090
This is exactly our Archimedean property from our axioms.

173
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,940
It just tells us that no matter how small a number epsilon is

174
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,040
we can always exceed any number we want.

175
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,050
Just by adding the number finitely many times.

176
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,000
Therefore we just find a suitable "N" here.

177
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,880
Now having this we can finally read the proof from left to right.

178
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,350
and everything makes sense.

179
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,930
and also of course our statement is proven.

180
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,300
Ok. Here you have seen what your thinking process should be when you want to solve such a problem.

181
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,270
You start with the things you need to put in

182
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,800
and the things you want to show in the end.

183
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,850
and then you try to fill in all gaps

184
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,550
such that in the end you can read it from left to right.

185
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,550
This means that sometimes you need to shift the things a little bit around

186
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,570
to get your result in the end.

187
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,900
Ok. I think this is good enough for today.

188
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,640
I hope i see you in the next video,

189
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,000
when we talk about the properties of a convergent sequence.

190
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,380
So have a nice day and see you then. Bye!
