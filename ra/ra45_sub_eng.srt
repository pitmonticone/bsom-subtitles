00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,250
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,259 --> 00:00:03,819
 real analysis.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,130
 And you already know as always

4
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,329
 first, I want to thank all

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,449
 the nice people that support

6
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,630
 this channel on study or

7
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,289
 paypal.

8
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,569
 Now, in today's part 45

9
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:13,689
 we will talk about a very

10
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:15,670
 famous theorem namely

11
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,930
 Taylor's theorem.

12
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,329
 This one is very important

13
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,809
 for a lot of applications

14
00:00:20,819 --> 00:00:21,930
 and you might have already

15
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,450
 heard the term Taylor

16
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:24,409
 polynomial.

17
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,639
 In fact, the overall idea

18
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:28,440
 here is not hard to understand

19
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:29,780
 because it's about an

20
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,200
 approximation method.

21
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:33,049
 Therefore, what you should

22
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,790
 imagine here is the graph

23
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,689
 of a function that is a few

24
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,090
 times differentiable.

25
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:41,040
 And then one will fix one

26
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:42,240
 point in the domain.

27
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,720
 And as often it's called

28
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:44,560
 X zero.

29
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:47,060
 Now around this 0.1

30
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:48,639
 wants a local approximation

31
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,500
 for the function.

32
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,799
 And for this reason, this

33
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,790
 point X zero is often called

34
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,000
 the expansion point.

35
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,389
 OK.

36
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,189
 Now I already told you we

37
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,900
 want an approximation around

38
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:01,549
 this point and this should

39
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,270
 be given by a polynomial.

40
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,379
 In fact, you already know

41
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:07,209
 the simplest one given by

42
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:07,989
 the tangent.

43
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,599
 Please recall this is the

44
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,169
 linear approximation we

45
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,629
 introduced in the definition

46
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:14,730
 of the derivative.

47
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:17,550
 In other words, here we have

48
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:19,220
 a polynomial with decree

49
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:19,699
 one.

50
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,199
 Indeed.

51
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:22,739
 Now Taylor's theorem

52
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,519
 generalizes this fact to

53
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:26,400
 polynomials with higher decrease.

54
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:28,440
 Hence, in the picture, with

55
00:01:28,449 --> 00:01:30,120
 the next step, we would have

56
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:30,959
 a parabola.

57
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:33,190
 And in the same way as the

58
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:34,739
 tangent was the best linear

59
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,080
 approximation, this

60
00:01:36,089 --> 00:01:37,709
 parabola should be the best

61
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,120
 quadratic approximation.

62
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:41,639
 Now what this exactly

63
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,470
 means we have to describe

64
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,470
 with a formula.

65
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:47,019
 Therefore, let's first recall

66
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:48,669
 the best linear approximation

67
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,389
 we defined with the derivative.

68
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:52,410
 In order to do this, we will

69
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:53,989
 introduce a new variable,

70
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,949
 we call h, should be

71
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,650
 a small number we add to

72
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,459
 X zero.

73
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:00,610
 In this sense, the point

74
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,480
 X zero plus H will be

75
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,739
 our point X.

76
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,669
 Indeed often this h makes

77
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,000
 the whole formulation a little

78
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:08,800
 bit simpler.

79
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,679
 Now, what we find by the

80
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,000
 definition of the derivative

81
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:13,720
 is that F of X

82
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,380
 zero plus h

83
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:17,350
 given by F of X zero

84
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,919
 plus F prime of X

85
00:02:19,929 --> 00:02:20,929
 zero times h

86
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:23,979
 plus a remainder term

87
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,600
 R of h times h.

88
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,559
 Now here when you compare

89
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,990
 to our original definition

90
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,479
 of the derivative, you see that

91
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,179
 h now plays the role of

92
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,630
 X minus X zero.

93
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,830
 Hence, in this formulation,

94
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,580
 the linear term here is

95
00:02:38,589 --> 00:02:39,949
 easy to recognize.

96
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:41,330
 OK.

97
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:42,710
 Now, one important property

98
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,360
 missing here is that R of

99
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:46,339
 H goes to zero

100
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,039
 when H goes to zero.

101
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:50,279
 In fact, this is the proper,

102
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,800
 that makes the tangent the

103
00:02:51,809 --> 00:02:53,399
 best linear approximation.

104
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,720
 OK.

105
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:56,500
 Now, maybe not so surprising

106
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,039
 in a similar way, we can

107
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,190
 write down a quadratic

108
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,119
 approximation.

109
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:02,210
 Of course, the linear term

110
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,440
 here should not change.

111
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,669
 But now we want to add a

112
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:06,309
 term with squared.

113
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,759
 And as we will see soon,

114
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,020
 the best quadratic

115
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:11,580
 approximation is then given

116
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:13,580
 with one half times F

117
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:15,419
 prime prime of X

118
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,369
 zero times H squared.

119
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:20,270
 And in a similar way as before,

120
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:21,770
 we have a remainder term,

121
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:22,929
 which is not the same, but

122
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,020
 we still call it r.

123
00:03:25,089 --> 00:03:26,869
 But now we have it here

124
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,190
 with h squared.

125
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,809
 Moreover, please don't forget

126
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:31,050
 that.

127
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:32,729
 Speaking of an approximation,

128
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,160
 this still means that this

129
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:35,729
 function r goes to

130
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,250
 zero when h goes to

131
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:37,800
 zero.

132
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,039
 OK.

133
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,470
 And now it might not surprise

134
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,009
 you that we can generalize

135
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,770
 this approximation to

136
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:45,750
 polynomials with higher degree

137
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,690
 when we have enough derivatives.

138
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,240
 And exactly this idea

139
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,080
 leads to Taylor's theorem.

140
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,970
 Therefore, let's formulate

141
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:55,289
 it.

142
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,600
 So the only thing we need

143
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,369
 is a function defined on

144
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,089
 an interval.

145
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,000
 I hence,

146
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,399
 let's call it F as

147
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,039
 before.

148
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:06,809
 Now, we already know we need

149
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,139
 enough derivatives.

150
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,839
 Therefore, let's assume that

151
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,580
 the function F is N plus

152
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:12,720
 one times different.

153
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:15,100
 The reason why this plus

154
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,928
 one is helpful you will see

155
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,619
 in a minute.

156
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:18,910
 OK.

157
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,820
 And as before we also fix

158
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,779
 an expansion point X zero.

159
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,170
 Now, the claim here is that

160
00:04:25,179 --> 00:04:27,160
 for any number H we have

161
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,720
 such an approximation formula,

162
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,609
 namely this means that we

163
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:32,529
 take any from the real number

164
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,529
 line such that X zero plus

165
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,369
 H still lies in I,

166
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,559
 this is important because

167
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,350
 only then we can put this

168
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:41,940
 number into the function

169
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,390
 F.

170
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,010
 Hence, in this case, F of

171
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,880
 X zero plus H is given

172
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,059
 as a whole sum

173
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:50,850
 of all the derives of the

174
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:52,589
 function F at the point

175
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,339
 X zero.

176
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,750
 So please keep in mind this

177
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,670
 is a real number and we divide

178
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:59,220
 it by K factorial.

179
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,589
 OK.

180
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,880
 So here you should see we

181
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,239
 start with case equal to

182
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,760
 zero, which is just a

183
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:06,600
 function F at the point X

184
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:06,970
 zero.

185
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,079
 And then we go through all

186
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:10,540
 the derivatives until we

187
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:11,760
 reach the nth one.

188
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:13,829
 Also, you should note that

189
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,720
 we don't see the K factorial

190
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,209
 at the first two terms here

191
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,170
 because for K is equal to

192
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:20,690
 zero and K is equal to

193
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,429
 one, we just get the factor

194
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:22,890
 one.

195
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:25,119
 However, at K is equal to

196
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,950
 two, we see one half

197
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:29,359
 and this means the next factor

198
00:05:29,369 --> 00:05:30,660
 will be 1/6.

199
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:31,769
 OK?

200
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:33,089
 Now you might ask how this

201
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,660
 factor comes in and I can

202
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,040
 tell you we will see it in

203
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:37,010
 the proof soon.

204
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,170
 However, more importantly,

205
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:40,320
 here, I should tell you that

206
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:41,899
 we also have our variable

207
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,109
 in namely with H to the

208
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:44,899
 power K.

209
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:47,049
 Hence what we get here is

210
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:48,799
 indeed a polynomial with

211
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:50,260
 degree at most N.

212
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,070
 And as we have seen before,

213
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,329
 we also have a remainder

214
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:55,470
 term at the end.

215
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,679
 And this one, I just want

216
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,200
 to denote with a capital

217
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:01,070
 R and in

218
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,660
 addition, it gets an index

219
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,429
 N, of course, the

220
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,799
 whole remainder term also

221
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:07,260
 depends on X zero.

222
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,260
 But for us, mainly the functional

223
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,200
 relation to h is important.

224
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:13,679
 Therefore, you see, we often

225
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,410
 just say ah and of H

226
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,010
 for the whole remainder term.

227
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:19,380
 However, the more important

228
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,049
 part is the front part.

229
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:22,510
 So the whole polynomial,

230
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,470
 in fact, this one is called

231
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,239
 the Taylor polynomial or

232
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,980
 more concretely the nth

233
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,619
 order Taylor polynomial.

234
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:31,839
 OK.

235
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,000
 Now, the whole claim here

236
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,299
 is not finished yet

237
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,890
 because of course, as

238
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:37,630
 before, we can say

239
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,859
 something about the remainder

240
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:39,519
 term here.

241
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,600
 Indeed, the remainder term

242
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,279
 gets better when we have

243
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,000
 one derivative more than

244
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,829
 we need for the Taylor polynomial.

245
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,079
 From this.

246
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:49,380
 It follows that we find an

247
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,179
 intermediate point we call

248
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:52,970
 C, this is a

249
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,559
 lower case Greek letter

250
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,540
 also often called Xi.

251
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,470
 Now, the important part is

252
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,239
 that this number lies in

253
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,200
 between X zero and X

254
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:03,160
 zero plus H.

255
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:05,459
 This means that if we want

256
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,279
 to write this as an interval,

257
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,559
 we have to distinguish two

258
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,200
 cases.

259
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,450
 It just depends which of

260
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:13,309
 the two numbers here is bigger

261
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,140
 than the other one.

262
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,239
 So we don't know the exact

263
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,000
 value of the number C here,

264
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,350
 but we know the range of

265
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:19,549
 it.

266
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,980
 However often this is

267
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:23,660
 enough for an estimate of

268
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,399
 the remainder term are and

269
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,019
 of h.

270
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,429
 And in fact, the formula

271
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,880
 for the remainder term is

272
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,420
 so easy to remember

273
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:33,140
 because it looks exactly

274
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:34,540
 like the last term in the

275
00:07:34,549 --> 00:07:35,679
 Taylor polynomial.

276
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:37,760
 More concretely, the number

277
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:39,209
 of the derivative is N plus

278
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,040
 one and we divide by

279
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:42,579
 N plus one factorial.

280
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,730
 In addition, at the end,

281
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:46,730
 we have to the power N

282
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:47,380
 plus one.

283
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:49,500
 However, we find the

284
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,890
 difference and this is the

285
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:52,309
 only one we don't

286
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,649
 evaluate the function at

287
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,809
 the point X zero.

288
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,369
 But now at the point

289
00:07:56,429 --> 00:07:58,309
 C OK,

290
00:07:58,339 --> 00:07:59,230
 there we have it.

291
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,170
 This whole thing is the famous

292
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:02,959
 Taylor formula which holds

293
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,750
 for every function F

294
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,170
 which is often enough

295
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:06,910
 differentiable.

296
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,899
 And maybe I should tell you

297
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,779
 sometimes you also see it

298
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,769
 in a different form.

299
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:13,959
 This happens when one is

300
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,940
 interested in a Taylor polynomial

301
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,420
 but not in the explicit

302
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:18,929
 calculation for the remainder

303
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,380
 term.

304
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:21,589
 Then one just writes

305
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,440
 plus big O of

306
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,929
 h to the power and plus

307
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,589
 one, it just

308
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,269
 reminds us that here in the

309
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,600
 remainder term

310
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:31,429
 occurs with the power N plus

311
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:31,910
 one.

312
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:34,030
 But we don't care how big

313
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,229
 the constant here is.

314
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,169
 Now, this curved O here is

315
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,020
 what we call a Landau symbol.

316
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:42,080
 And at the moment, we just

317
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,469
 use it as a shortcut for

318
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:44,770
 the whole remainder term

319
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,169
 here.

320
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:47,750
 However, later, I will tell

321
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,989
 you a little bit more about

322
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,650
 this symbol and related

323
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:51,070
 ones.

324
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:52,349
 OK.

325
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,950
 Now, for the end of the theorem,

326
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,830
 let me show you once again

327
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,780
 another formulation for this

328
00:08:57,789 --> 00:08:58,669
 formula here.

329
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,700
 This happens if you don't

330
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,869
 want to use the variable,

331
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,719
 but rather just to point

332
00:09:03,729 --> 00:09:05,390
 X in the interval I,

333
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:07,679
 then of course, all the

334
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,330
 constants are the same.

335
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,820
 But now we have the factor

336
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,320
 X minus X zero.

337
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,789
 And obviously we also need

338
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,929
 the power K here.

339
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:18,349
 So now you see there is no

340
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:19,479
 difference at all.

341
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,520
 It just depends which variables

342
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,080
 you want to use in your problem.

343
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,320
 However, here please note

344
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,880
 both things, either with

345
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,659
 variable H or with variable

346
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,650
 X are called the nth order

347
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:31,719
 Taylor polynomial.

348
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:33,099
 OK.

349
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:34,659
 Then I would say in the next

350
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:35,880
 videos we can discuss

351
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,690
 examples applications

352
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,469
 and also the proof of this

353
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,780
 nice theorem here.

354
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:42,570
 Therefore, I hope I see you

355
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,059
 there and have a nice day.

356
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:44,940
 Bye.
