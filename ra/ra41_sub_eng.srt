00:00:00,389 --> 00:00:02,289
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:03,859
 real analysis.

3
00:00:04,289 --> 00:00:05,889
 And first many, many thanks

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,130
 to all the nice people that

5
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:08,500
 support this channel on Steady 

6
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,220
 or paypal.

7
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:11,449
 Now today, in part 41 we

8
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,680
 will finally talk about the

9
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:13,979
 famous mean value

10
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:14,770
 theorem.

11
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,850
 Indeed, this theorem we can

12
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,360
 immediately visualize in

13
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,180
 a nice way.

14
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,170
 Now I can already tell you

15
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,850
 the mean value theorem applies

16
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,059
 to all functions that are

17
00:00:24,069 --> 00:00:25,920
 defined on a compact interval

18
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,120
 and differentiable.

19
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,629
 Therefore, let's call the

20
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:29,909
 interval on the X axis

21
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,389
 simply A B.

22
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,459
 OK.

23
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,880
 And now we look at the mean

24
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:35,159
 slope of the function

25
00:00:35,889 --> 00:00:37,470
 which is the slope of this

26
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:37,950
 second.

27
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,959
 And of course, we can immediately

28
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,819
 calculate this by F of B

29
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,819
 minus F of A divided by

30
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,069
 B minus A.

31
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,860
 Now, the claim of the mean

32
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:48,209
 value theorem is that we

33
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,939
 also find a tangent with

34
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,020
 the same slope.

35
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,740
 So in the picture, this would

36
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,159
 mean we can push this

37
00:00:54,169 --> 00:00:56,130
 sequence until we find the

38
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,139
 correct slope

39
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,590
 and the corresponding point

40
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:01,459
 in the interval A B we call

41
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,450
 X hat all in

42
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:05,089
 all this is already the

43
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,010
 whole mean value theorem.

44
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,089
 In other words, at this point,

45
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:10,449
 we are ready to formulate

46
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:12,290
 it the only assumption we

47
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,809
 need here is a differentiable

48
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:15,809
 function FF should be

49
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:17,319
 defined on a compact interval.

50
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,970
 So we choose it as a B.

51
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,290
 And of course, the whole

52
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,739
 thing only makes sense if

53
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,690
 A is strictly less than B,

54
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,019
 then the claim is there exists

55
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:27,610
 a point x hat in the

56
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,690
 open interval.

57
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,959
 So indeed, we find an inner

58
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,720
 point and for this

59
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,930
 point, we have the property

60
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,449
 that F prime of X hat

61
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,160
 is exactly the mean

62
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:37,639
 slope.

63
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:39,660
 So you see the whole theorem

64
00:01:39,669 --> 00:01:41,360
 is very easy to formulate.

65
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,720
 And therefore also to

66
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,540
 remember, you can simply

67
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,230
 say the second slope is

68
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,870
 given by some tangent slope

69
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,589
 in the middle.

70
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,650
 However, please note here,

71
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,949
 the statement of the theorem

72
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,519
 is the existence not the

73
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:54,330
 uniqueness.

74
00:01:54,779 --> 00:01:56,190
 So it's definitely possible

75
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,260
 that you could have many

76
00:01:57,269 --> 00:01:58,879
 X hats with this property.

77
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:00,779
 For example, for constant

78
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,230
 function F you immediately

79
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:02,879
 see this.

80
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,029
 OK.

81
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,650
 Then let's use the next minutes

82
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,129
 to prove the mean value

83
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:07,849
 theorem.

84
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,899
 And of course, we will need

85
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,600
 Rolle's theorem from the last

86
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,139
 video.

87
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,949
 Indeed, we can immediately

88
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,440
 apply it in the case that

89
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:17,009
 F of A is equal to F of

90
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,429
 B.

91
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,509
 Because in this case, Rolle's

92
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,960
 theorem tells us there is

93
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,800
 an X set in the open interval

94
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,770
 A B such that the derivative

95
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:26,529
 at this point is exactly

96
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:27,100
 zero.

97
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,570
 However zero is in this

98
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,229
 case, the mean slope.

99
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,369
 Hence, in this case, we have

100
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,059
 already proven the mean value

101
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,639
 theorem.

102
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,479
 Therefore, the idea for the

103
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,339
 proof would be to formulate

104
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,860
 the general case such that

105
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,429
 we can use this special case

106
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:42,779
 here.

107
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:44,690
 Indeed, this is not hard

108
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:46,350
 at all when we have the picture

109
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:46,880
 in mind.

110
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,839
 So in dark blue, we have

111
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,500
 the function F and light

112
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:52,100
 blue gives us the second.

113
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,199
 And now we want to push this

114
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,199
 value here to the same level

115
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,220
 as this value.

116
00:02:57,869 --> 00:02:59,210
 Therefore, in the picture,

117
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,649
 this point should go down

118
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,410
 exactly by the amount given

119
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:03,179
 by the second.

120
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:05,410
 So you see the overall idea

121
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,869
 is simply to subtract the

122
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,270
 sequence from the function.

123
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,500
 Then the result is that both

124
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:12,000
 points lie at zero

125
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:13,940
 and we have a new function

126
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:15,289
 we can call G.

127
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:17,029
 Now, the important thing

128
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,339
 here is that the new function

129
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,270
 G is still differentiable

130
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:21,710
 because it's a difference

131
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,429
 of two differential functions.

132
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,460
 And moreover, it's still

133
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,940
 defined on the interval.

134
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,830
 Ab Now the definition we

135
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:30,020
 described in the picture

136
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:32,020
 is here given in this formula

137
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,970
 which is exactly what we

138
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:34,580
 wanted.

139
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,339
 The function F minus the

140
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,899
 second.

141
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:38,830
 So here we have the constant

142
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:40,740
 slope times X minus a

143
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,740
 point A plus F at

144
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,660
 this point A.

145
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,770
 And of course, here A is

146
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:47,369
 the left bound of the interval.

147
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:48,169
 OK.

148
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:49,759
 Here because G is still

149
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,520
 differentiable, we can calculate

150
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:53,100
 the relative, of course,

151
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,339
 you can apply the sum rule.

152
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,929
 So we have F prime minus

153
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,250
 the slope of the second.

154
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,800
 So here you see we are already

155
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:01,539
 very close to the mean value

156
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,199
 theorem.

157
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
 Now the only thing that is

158
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:05,410
 left to do here is to apply

159
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:06,600
 Rolle's theorem.

160
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,699
 Please recall before we could

161
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,720
 use it in the case that the

162
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:11,169
 left value is equal to the

163
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:11,899
 right value.

164
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,169
 And then we found a middle

165
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:14,600
 point such that the derivative

166
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,729
 is zero there.

167
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,630
 However, now we are in the

168
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,519
 case that F of A is not

169
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,700
 equal to F of B,

170
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,420
 but we shifted the whole

171
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,160
 problem such that G

172
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,470
 fulfills what we want.

173
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,799
 If you don't believe it,

174
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:28,320
 put A and B into the

175
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:30,000
 definition and you see it

176
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:32,019
 hence, now we can apply Rolle's

177
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,739
 theorem and find a point

178
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,239
 X hat where the derivative

179
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:35,980
 is zero.

180
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,980
 However, vanishing the relative

181
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:39,500
 for G means that this

182
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,380
 expression is equal to zero.

183
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:43,579
 So we simply bring F prime

184
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:44,589
 to the other side.

185
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:47,010
 So not so surprising we found

186
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:48,700
 our mean value theorem.

187
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:51,019
 And indeed this is the whole

188
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:51,500
 proof.

189
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:52,440
 OK.

190
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,769
 Then for the end of the video,

191
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:55,579
 let's look at an application

192
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:57,079
 of this nice theorem.

193
00:04:57,549 --> 00:04:58,970
 Again, let's take a function

194
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,649
 F defined on a compact

195
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,179
 interval.

196
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,970
 And of course, it should

197
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,070
 be differential.

198
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:06,410
 Now assume that we know that

199
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,790
 the derivative is positive

200
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:09,089
 no matter which point X we

201
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,549
 put in.

202
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:12,140
 Then we can look at two arbitrarily

203
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:14,019
 chosen points X one and X

204
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:16,010
 two, where X two is greater

205
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,869
 than X one, then we

206
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,049
 can apply the mean value

207
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:20,410
 theorem where we shrink the

208
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,980
 domain to the interval X

209
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:22,809
 one X two.

210
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,609
 This means that we find our

211
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:26,369
 point X hat in the open

212
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,920
 interval X one X two.

213
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,070
 And as before, at this point,

214
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,589
 we find the mean slope,

215
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,679
 then we can just multiply

216
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,269
 X two minus X one on both

217
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,510
 sides and get this

218
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,309
 equality.

219
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:39,450
 Now, we can put in our two

220
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:40,170
 assumptions.

221
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:41,809
 First, we know the derivative

222
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,809
 is positive.

223
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,079
 And secondly, we know X two

224
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:46,950
 minus X one is positive as

225
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:47,290
 well.

226
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,170
 Hence, we can conclude the

227
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:50,890
 left hand side of the equality

228
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:52,410
 is also positive,

229
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,359
 which means the value

230
00:05:54,369 --> 00:05:56,160
 FX two is greater than the

231
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,480
 value FX one.

232
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,239
 And since the numbers X one

233
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,200
 X two were arbitrarily chosen,

234
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:02,559
 we conclude that the function

235
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,420
 F is increasing or

236
00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:05,459
 more concretely, we would

237
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,859
 say F is strictly

238
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:08,579
 monotonically increasing.

239
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,619
 Now, indeed, this is a nice

240
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,160
 result.

241
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,510
 We merely get out of the

242
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,980
 mean value theorem.

243
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,510
 So in short, we can simply

244
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,070
 say if the derivative is

245
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,679
 always positive, we get out

246
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,910
 a function that is at all

247
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,660
 points increasing strictly

248
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,670
 monotonically.

249
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,359
 And of course, with a similar

250
00:06:24,369 --> 00:06:25,940
 proof, we can also look at

251
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,829
 cases with a negative derivative.

252
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:29,750
 This case might not surprise

253
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,029
 you.

254
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,309
 We simply get out that the

255
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,070
 function is strictly monotonically

256
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:33,760
 decreasing.

257
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,709
 Then in addition, we can

258
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,239
 also look at the cases where

259
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,380
 we don't have the strict

260
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,200
 inequality.

261
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,970
 This means if you look at

262
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,640
 the proof, we will also lose

263
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:44,239
 the strict inequality here.

264
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,119
 Otherwise the proof works

265
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,309
 exactly the same.

266
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:49,049
 However, since we lose the

267
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:50,119
 strict inequality.

268
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,339
 We just have functions that

269
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,940
 are monotonically increasing

270
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,049
 or decreasing.

271
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:54,869
 OK.

272
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,980
 With this, we now have a

273
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:57,380
 common application for

274
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,130
 derivatives when we want to analyze

275
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,920
 functions.

276
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:01,369
 And of course, this will

277
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,220
 come in handy a lot later.

278
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:05,239
 Therefore, I really hope

279
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,140
 I see you in later videos.

280
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,519
 Have a nice day and bye.
