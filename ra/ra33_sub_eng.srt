00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,329
Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:03,880
real analysis.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,969
And first many, many thanks

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,179
to all the nice supporters

5
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,670
on steady or paypal.

6
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,630
Now, in this video today,

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,840
you will get to know some

8
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,180
important continuous

9
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:13,869
functions.

10
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,180
Some of them are so important

11
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,319
that they are often called

12
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:18,780
elementary functions.

13
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:21,159
Indeed, all of them we will

14
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,620
consider again later when

15
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:24,040
we differentiate and

16
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:24,899
integrate.

17
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,579
Hence, let's immediately

18
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,000
start with the most important

19
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:28,420
one.

20
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,879
The exponential function

21
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,709
we shorten the name with

22
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,669
X and the domain is the whole

23
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,700
real number line.

24
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,369
And we have already learned

25
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,759
in the former video that

26
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,619
it is defined by a series,

27
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,029
namely we have X to the power

28
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,540
K divided by K

29
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:44,580
factorial.

30
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,669
And now you might already

31
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,509
know at the point X is equal

32
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,810
to one, we find the

33
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:51,540
so-called Euler number.

34
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,830
Also it's possible to show

35
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,389
that this number can be defined

36
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,630
by another sequence

37
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,000
namely by the limit one

38
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:00,599
plus one over N to the

39
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,430
power N which is

40
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:02,939
roughly

41
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,910
2.718.

42
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:07,040
Now this exponential function

43
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,779
shouldn't be new to you because

44
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,099
we have already discussed

45
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,500
it in part 22

46
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:13,260
there, we have shown the

47
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:14,860
fundamental multiplicative

48
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,580
identity for the exponential

49
00:01:16,589 --> 00:01:18,000
function which

50
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,339
translates the addition

51
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:20,489
inside into a

52
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,120
multiplication outside.

53
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,879
And because we have this

54
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:25,559
property, we can immediately

55
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:26,680
explain the name

56
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,559
exponential for this function.

57
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,989
For example, if we have X

58
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,870
of two, we can

59
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,669
write this as X of one

60
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,650
plus one

61
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,870
which is by our fundamental

62
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,489
multiplicative identity here

63
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,300
exactly X of one

64
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,580
times X of one.

65
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,419
So it's Euler number

66
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,209
squared.

67
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:47,790
So you see the left here

68
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,400
and the right hand side are

69
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:49,989
the same.

70
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:52,209
And indeed, we can show that

71
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,699
in general, the exponential

72
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:55,430
function X of X is

73
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,239
exactly Euler number to the

74
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:57,989
power X.

75
00:01:58,739 --> 00:01:59,959
Therefore, the name makes

76
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,529
sense because we can rewrite

77
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,019
a function such that we have

78
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:04,139
the exponent here.

79
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:05,980
And of course, we can show

80
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:07,750
even more properties of this

81
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,029
important function here.

82
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:10,860
The first part might not

83
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:11,779
surprise you.

84
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:13,029
The exponential function

85
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,619
is a continuous function.

86
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:16,820
So it's continuous at all

87
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,960
points in R.

88
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,149
Then the next property is

89
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,580
that this function is at

90
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:23,289
all points increasing

91
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,750
more concretely, we would

92
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,300
say the exponential function

93
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:27,960
is strictly monotonically

94
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,929
increasing, which simply

95
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,699
means if we look at two points

96
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,500
X and Y where Y is

97
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:35,369
greater than X, then also

98
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,990
the values fulfill the same

99
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,889
inequality.

100
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:40,029
So X of Y is greater

101
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,229
than X of X.

102
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,070
In addition, we can also

103
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,610
say what happens in the limits

104
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:46,559
X to infinity and X

105
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,929
to minus infinity

106
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,889
for plus infinity, we

107
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:51,369
exceed all bounds.

108
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,960
Therefore, we go to plus

109
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,649
infinity.

110
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,119
However, for minus infinity,

111
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,360
it's different because we

112
00:02:57,369 --> 00:02:59,160
stay positive the whole time

113
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:00,960
we reach zero in the limit.

114
00:03:01,429 --> 00:03:01,800
OK.

115
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:03,110
So these are the important

116
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:04,399
properties you really should

117
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,270
remember for the exponential

118
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:06,800
function.

119
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:08,919
Now, one important conclusion

120
00:03:08,929 --> 00:03:10,320
here is what we will need

121
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,669
for the next example.

122
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,720
Namely now you are able to

123
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:15,380
show if we change the codomain

124
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:16,619
to zero

125
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,509
infinity.

126
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:19,830
So the interval of the positive

127
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:21,679
numbers, then we

128
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,119
get a bijective map.

129
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,110
Indeed, that's not hard to

130
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:26,630
show when you know all the

131
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,410
other things here.

132
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:29,509
And of course, now you already

133
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,490
know a bijective map has

134
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,589
an inverse map.

135
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,339
And this inverse is what

136
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,149
we usually call the logarithm

137
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,830
function.

138
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,770
So you see this is a simple

139
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:40,259
definition and then we can

140
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,600
ask the question, what are

141
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,190
the properties of the logarithm

142
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:43,669
function?

143
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,050
And of course, not so surprising,

144
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,589
we can deduce a lot of

145
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,360
properties from the exponential

146
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:49,880
function.

147
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:51,309
So maybe let's look at the

148
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,960
graphs to see what we already

149
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,470
have.

150
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,690
So in blue, you see the graph

151
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:56,990
of the exponential function

152
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,809
and then we reflect it where

153
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,169
the mirror line is this

154
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:01,690
diagonal here.

155
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,449
Please recall this reflecting

156
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,500
follows immediately by the

157
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:06,089
definition of the graph and

158
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,089
the inverse function

159
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,250
HC.

160
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,580
And we, you find the graph

161
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:11,130
of the logarithm function.

162
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,960
Now what we see is that the

163
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,589
logarithm function is also

164
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,990
strictly monotonically

165
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,450
increasing and it should

166
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,029
still be continuous.

167
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,890
Indeed showing these two

168
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,890
things is a very good exercise.

169
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:24,700
First, you show the increasing

170
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:25,910
part and then you use the

171
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,519
epsilon delta criterion to

172
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:28,799
show the continuity.

173
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:29,859
OK.

174
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,239
However, the most important

175
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,459
property for the logarithm

176
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,049
function follows immediately

177
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:35,899
from the fundamental multiplicative

178
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,690
identity for the exponential

179
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,200
function.

180
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,000
OK.

181
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,320
Now, because the logarithm

182
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:42,160
function is the inverse function,

183
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,839
this identity goes the other

184
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,720
way around.

185
00:04:45,309 --> 00:04:47,179
So the product inside gets

186
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,739
translated to the sum

187
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,500
outside.

188
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,519
OK?

189
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:52,200
I can tell you this identity

190
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,380
is very important.

191
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,760
So please remember it.

192
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:56,690
Now, with this, we go to

193
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,589
our next examples which are

194
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,720
polynomials

195
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:00,839
for them.

196
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,829
I don't have to tell you

197
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,459
a lot because you already

198
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,079
know them.

199
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,959
The important part here is

200
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,579
the domain of a polynomial

201
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:08,970
is the whole real number

202
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,910
line and defined as it by

203
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,910
giving finitely many coefficients

204
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,279
A.

205
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,049
And in the case that the

206
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:16,970
last one am here is

207
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,950
nonzero.

208
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,570
We say that the polynomial

209
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:21,519
has to create M as a

210
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,839
reminder, we have already

211
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,239
showed that the polynomials

212
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,970
are continuous functions.

213
00:05:26,549 --> 00:05:27,929
So nothing new here.

214
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,890
But we need to know the polynomials

215
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:31,450
to define the next class

216
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:32,529
of examples

217
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,660
here.

218
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,029
Please recall for a

219
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,600
polynomial and important

220
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:38,309
ingredient was that we have

221
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,809
a highest power M here.

222
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,600
If we don't want to have

223
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:42,910
that, we get something we

224
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,549
call a power series.

225
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,660
In fact, this is a very general

226
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,209
term where we already know

227
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,220
one example,

228
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,630
namely the exponential function

229
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,540
from above was defined using

230
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:54,640
a power series.

231
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:56,880
Now, in general a power series

232
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,540
does not need to be defined

233
00:05:58,549 --> 00:05:59,730
on the whole real number

234
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:00,179
line.

235
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:02,149
So we could have a smaller

236
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,109
domain D.

237
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,320
However, otherwise it looks

238
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:06,750
like a polynomial where we

239
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,579
have coefficients A K here.

240
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:10,510
But now we could have infinitely

241
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,040
many.

242
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:12,880
In other words, for each

243
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,799
sequence A K, we get out

244
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:16,239
a function we call a power

245
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:16,880
series.

246
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,829
In this case, the domain

247
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,399
of definition is given by

248
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,940
all the points X in

249
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,899
R that satisfy

250
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,589
that this series is indeed

251
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,809
a convergent one.

252
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:28,790
And of course, you already

253
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:30,269
know a lot of criteria you

254
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,709
can use here to check for

255
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,510
convergence.

256
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,279
OK.

257
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,489
Let's immediately discuss

258
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,329
a very famous example here

259
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:37,899
which means we fix a special

260
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:38,420
sequence.

261
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:40,260
A K let's start a

262
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:41,549
sequence with the zeroth

263
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:42,839
member which should be

264
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:43,570
zero.

265
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:45,679
And then I want one, but

266
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,670
let's write it as one divided

267
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:49,010
by one factorial,

268
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,339
then afterwards comes zero

269
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,910
again and then

270
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,720
minus one divided by

271
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,230
three factorial.

272
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:58,109
Then not surprising we have

273
00:06:58,119 --> 00:06:59,820
zero again and then one

274
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:01,820
divided by five factorial,

275
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,809
then zero and then

276
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,570
minus one divided by

277
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:06,820
seven factorial.

278
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:07,829
OK.

279
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,109
With this, I think you see

280
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,440
what the whole wall is and

281
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,829
that you can continue it.

282
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:14,279
And now this sequence gives

283
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,070
us a power series we usually

284
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,899
call sine of X.

285
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:19,779
Also, it's not hard to check

286
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,019
that the whole real number

287
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:22,600
line is the domain D

288
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:24,899
indeed, a lot of common functions

289
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,339
can be defined with such

290
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,420
a power series.

291
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,299
And for this reason, I give

292
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:31,119
you here a general result.

293
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,160
Now, for any power series,

294
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,529
given the coefficients A

295
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,079
K, you find the

296
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,000
maximum radius R

297
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,500
where also infinity as a

298
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,959
symbol is possible,

299
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:43,720
which indeed would be the

300
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,170
best case scenario.

301
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,019
Now, this maximum radius

302
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:48,910
fulfills that the open interval

303
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,890
from minus R to R lies

304
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:52,350
completely in the domain

305
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:52,760
D.

306
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:54,829
Now I can also tell you we

307
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,989
immediately get that the

308
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,700
power series is a continuous

309
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,510
function on this interval.

310
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,100
So in the best case scenario

311
00:08:01,109 --> 00:08:02,640
like for the sine function,

312
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,239
we have a continuous function

313
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,549
defined on the whole real

314
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:06,320
number line.

315
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,649
Now even better for the theorem,

316
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,570
we have a formula to calculate

317
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:11,690
this number R.

318
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,609
Indeed this comes out of

319
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,579
the root criterion for the.

320
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,989
Therefore, we can calculate

321
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,609
the lim sup of the cave

322
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:20,309
root of the

323
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,109
absolute value of A K.

324
00:08:22,609 --> 00:08:24,269
And this gives us the number

325
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,549
one over R.

326
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:27,549
And here in this case for

327
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:29,230
zero and infinity, we

328
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:31,089
use this symbolic calculation

329
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:33,030
using this, we have this

330
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,390
formula in general.

331
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,308
OK.

332
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,789
Now this nice formula is

333
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,409
often called the Cauchy Hadamard

334
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,058
theorem.

335
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,130
With this, I would say we've

336
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,558
learned a lot today and we

337
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,140
can start with derivatives

338
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,200
in the next video.

339
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,900
Therefore, I hope I see you

340
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:48,270
there and have a nice day.

341
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,070
Bye.
