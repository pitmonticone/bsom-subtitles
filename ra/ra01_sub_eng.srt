00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello and welcome to real analysis

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,200
and first I want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:11,399
This is part 1 of a new course

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,590
where we talk about the analysis we can do with the real numbers.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,790
Before we start with it I can tell you

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,980
you will always find the PDF versions of these videos and the quizzes

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,680
where you can test your understanding of these topics

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,700
in the description below.

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,890
Now, the topic of real analysis is also known as calculus.

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,090
But there are also a lot of other names.

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,290
For example just analysis or infinitesimal calculus.

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,490
So you might recognize your lecture here,

13
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,690
but of course the name is not important.

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,890
The goal of the course is important.

15
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:50,090
This should be in the end the understanding of differential and integral calculations.

16
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,280
Therefore in the end you will be able to understand everything 

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,480
about the symbol "df/dx"

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,670
and also about the integral symbol "f dx".

19
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,170
With this you might already guess some of the topics we will cover here.

20
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,370
First we will look at sequences of real numbers

21
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,570
and then define what limits are.

22
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:15,360
Afterwards we will talk about functions that are continuous.

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Then, usually it gets easier when we talk about derivatives.

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,760
In the end integrals will close our real analysis course.

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
So you see, we have a lot to cover here.

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,150
Therefore I should tell you what the requirements are for this course.

27
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,000
Indeed, this is very simple to say.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I can put it into two words.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,200
You just have to know the real numbers.

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,200
You don't need much else,

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,400
if you know how to calculate in the real numbers "R",

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,000
you know everything to follow this course.

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,400
In the case you don't know the real numbers.

34
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,400
That is not a problem, because I have a whole video course about them.

35
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,600
In "Start Learning Mathematics" you find everything you need.

36
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,000
and the important videos are the ones about the real numbers.

37
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Therefore it might be sufficient to look at "Start Learning Reals".

38
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,400
For us here, we will take the axioms of the real numbers

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,389
as our foundation.

40
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,590
Indeed they are not so complicated.

41
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,790
We just have a set with two operations:

42
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,990
addition and multiplication

43
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,000
and also with an ordering such that we have all these properties here.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,480
Roughly they tell us that we have a field of numbers

45
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,680
that are also nicely ordered.

46
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,000
Which simply means that we can visualize the real numbers as the number line.

47
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,480
and the last property here is the completeness axiom,

48
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,680
which talks about sequences.

49
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,170
But don't worry. We will talk about sequences a lot soon.

50
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,370
Therefore you will understand this axiom in the end.

51
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,660
However, what we need immediately from the beginning

52
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,000
is the so called "absolute value" of a real number.

53
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,190
So you see, it always gives us a positive number or zero.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
In other words, it measures the distance from 0 to the point x.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,190
Soon we will see it is very important that we can measure distances 

56
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,760
to do real analysis.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,580
That is what the definition of a limit

58
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,000
or the definition of the derivatives needs.

59
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,190
Now, what you really should know is what to do

60
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,480
when you have two numbers in the absolute value.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,580
So they could be combined by multiplication or by addition.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,770
For the multiplication nothing special happens.

63
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,960
You can just split it up into the two absolute values.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,740
However, for the addition this is not true.

65
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,050
There we just have an inequality.

66
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,250
and this is called the "triangle inequality".

67
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,450
and we will use that a lot.

68
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,640
Ok! I think that is good enough for a short introduction here.

69
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:47,200
In the next video we will start with our real analysis course

70
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,400
by considering sequences.

71
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,490
Therefore I hope I see you there and have a nice day.

72
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,380
Bye!
