00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,049
 Hello and welcome back

2
00:00:02,059 --> 00:00:03,559
 to distributions.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,369
 And first, as always, I want

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,849
 to thank all the nice people

5
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,909
 that support this channel

6
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,289
 on Steady or paypal.

7
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,130
 In today's part six, we will

8
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,409
 show that the delta

9
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,189
 distribution is not a

10
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:15,560
 regular distribution.

11
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,940
 So usually we say it's a

12
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,329
 singular distribution

13
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,309
 more concretely, this means

14
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:22,709
 there's no locally

15
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,370
 integrable function F

16
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:26,819
 defined on RN with

17
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:28,600
 values in R or C as

18
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,090
 always with the

19
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,670
 property that delta of

20
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,290
 Phi is the same as

21
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,680
 TF of Phi.

22
00:00:35,349 --> 00:00:36,830
 And of course, this property

23
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,529
 should hold for all test

24
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,509
 functions Phi, OK.

25
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,439
 Now, as a reminder TF of

26
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,310
 Phi was defined by the

27
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:45,130
 integral.

28
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,200
 So we integrate FX

29
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:49,130
 times Phi X and

30
00:00:49,139 --> 00:00:50,130
 we already showed in the

31
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:51,869
 last video that for locally

32
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,360
 integral with function F,

33
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:54,689
 this always defines a

34
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,650
 distribution.

35
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,389
 On the other hand, if we

36
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,810
 put Phi into the delta

37
00:00:58,819 --> 00:01:00,349
 distribution, we get out

38
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,759
 the value of Phi at

39
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,409
 zero.

40
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,650
 Now, our claim here is for

41
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,459
 no F this equality is

42
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,180
 possible.

43
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,220
 Indeed, this is a standard

44
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,199
 exercise.

45
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,760
 And here I want to show you

46
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:12,739
 the proof of it.

47
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:14,459
 Let's do it with a proof

48
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,720
 by contradiction.

49
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:17,690
 Therefore, let's assume that

50
00:01:17,699 --> 00:01:19,230
 we find such a function

51
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,190
 F.

52
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:21,449
 So it's a locally integrable

53
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,059
 function where we usually

54
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:24,389
 use this symbol here.

55
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,559
 And now this property here

56
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:28,269
 will lead to a contradiction.

57
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:29,290
 OK.

58
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,739
 Now, in the first step, I

59
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,129
 just want to integrate the

60
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:33,489
 function F itself.

61
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,790
 So we already know this gives

62
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,279
 us a finite number by

63
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,250
 assumption when we integrate

64
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,690
 over a compact set.

65
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:42,730
 And for this, let's simply

66
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:44,400
 choose the unit ball.

67
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,330
 One possibility to describe

68
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,839
 this would be simply to write

69
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:49,080
 that the Euclidean norm of

70
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:50,830
 X is less or equal than

71
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:51,279
 one.

72
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,389
 And in order to get a positive

73
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,150
 number out here, we also

74
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,959
 use the absolute value inside.

75
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:59,150
 Then we know we get out a

76
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,519
 number A which is a

77
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:02,250
 finite positive number.

78
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,069
 Now to get an idea of what

79
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,779
 we do here, let's sketch

80
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,069
 the region where we integrate

81
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,429
 over in the case that the

82
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,669
 dimension is two

83
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,429
 there, we just have this

84
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,139
 circle where we integrate

85
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:14,539
 over the whole disc.

86
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:16,419
 Now, what I want to do is

87
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:17,660
 to go closer to the

88
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,600
 0.0 to the origin

89
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,250
 because this is the one we

90
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:22,139
 are interested in.

91
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,520
 Therefore, we can take smaller

92
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:25,970
 and smaller circles here

93
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:27,339
 and can split up the whole

94
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,750
 region.

95
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:29,880
 Of course, we do this with

96
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:31,580
 infinitely many circles

97
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:33,169
 where we choose one over

98
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:34,660
 K as the radius.

99
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,860
 So we start with 1/1, then

100
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:38,199
 comes 1/2

101
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,979
 1/3 and so on.

102
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:41,800
 And then our idea is that

103
00:02:41,809 --> 00:02:43,600
 we can simply take the union

104
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,470
 of all these rings here.

105
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:47,619
 And then this infinite union

106
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,580
 is again the whole disc.

107
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,559
 OK.

108
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,639
 I don't think we need to

109
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:53,360
 formalize this even more

110
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,830
 because the idea should be

111
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:55,320
 clear.

112
00:02:55,929 --> 00:02:57,119
 The important thing we get

113
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,399
 is that here at the

114
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,369
 integral, we have a countable

115
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,000
 union.

116
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:02,929
 And now when you know some

117
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,619
 measure theory or integration

118
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,149
 theory, you immediately know

119
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,070
 what to do because here

120
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,699
 we have a disjoint union,

121
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:11,839
 we can simply write the whole

122
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,669
 integral as an infinite sum

123
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:15,380
 over the single integrals

124
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:16,380
 over the rings.

125
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,320
 Of course, this whole procedure

126
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,710
 here is very natural.

127
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,869
 But it's the thing we have

128
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,520
 to put in for the integrals.

129
00:03:23,309 --> 00:03:24,169
 In the case, you want to

130
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:25,660
 learn more about the details

131
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:27,169
 here, you can simply watch

132
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:28,860
 my measure theory videos.

133
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,059
 Now the result we get here

134
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,860
 is an infinite sum a series

135
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:34,619
 which has a finite value.

136
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:36,800
 Therefore, we can conclude

137
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:38,360
 that the sequence given by

138
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:40,139
 these integrals here is a

139
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:41,520
 sequence that converges to

140
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:42,139
 zero.

141
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,220
 And we know even more if

142
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:45,619
 we shift the starting point

143
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,479
 here, we can make this series

144
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,889
 as small as we want.

145
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,679
 For example, we could make

146
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,539
 it smaller than one half

147
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,929
 and I take one half because

148
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,300
 it's a number that is smaller

149
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:57,259
 than one.

150
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:58,800
 And this is what we need

151
00:03:58,809 --> 00:03:59,860
 for the contradiction.

152
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:00,869
 OK.

153
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,380
 And now we can just summarize

154
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:03,210
 the whole thing.

155
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,839
 I only did it to show

156
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,770
 you that we find an epsilon

157
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:07,949
 greater than zero.

158
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,979
 Such that the integral

159
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,830
 over the epsilon ball is

160
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:13,809
 a number B which is smaller

161
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,789
 than one half.

162
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,630
 So the whole explanation

163
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,410
 told you if we make the

164
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,190
 epsilon ball small enough,

165
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,910
 we can make the whole integral

166
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,350
 as small as we want.

167
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,380
 Of course, this makes totally

168
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,750
 sense if you just think of

169
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,369
 some ordinary functions.

170
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,549
 However, it also holds for

171
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,359
 a locally integrable function.

172
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,029
 Now, this was just a rough

173
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,369
 idea, but I don't think you

174
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,019
 will have any problems filling

175
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:37,950
 in the details.

176
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,670
 For example, one detail I

177
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,149
 skipped here is that in this

178
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,709
 union, we will not

179
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,510
 include zero as a point.

180
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,839
 However, since the whole

181
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,470
 integral here does not care

182
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,049
 about a single point, the

183
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:50,170
 whole calculation is still

184
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:50,790
 correct.

185
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,670
 OK.

186
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,290
 Now, with this result from

187
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:54,829
 the first step, we are ready

188
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,130
 to finish the proof

189
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:58,250
 because we look at the delta

190
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,609
 distribution, it would be

191
00:04:59,619 --> 00:05:01,410
 good to have test functions

192
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,609
 that are concentrated at

193
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:03,209
 zero.

194
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,910
 Indeed, we already know a

195
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,769
 nice one from part two of

196
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:08,769
 the video series, it was

197
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,750
 set to zero outside of

198
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,410
 the unit ball and

199
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,109
 inside the unit ball, it

200
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:15,769
 was given by an exponential

201
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:16,209
 function.

202
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,660
 This is a nice test function

203
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,510
 and the one dimensional visualization

204
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,399
 would be just such a bump

205
00:05:23,109 --> 00:05:24,410
 where the maximum is

206
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,989
 exactly at zero.

207
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:26,790
 OK.

208
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:27,980
 Now you already know from

209
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:29,420
 the first part, the unit

210
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,850
 ball might be not small

211
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:31,529
 enough.

212
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,670
 Therefore, we should take

213
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,200
 this epsilon ball here.

214
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:35,809
 Therefore, I would say let's

215
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,329
 change the function phi a

216
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:39,130
 little bit with this epsilon,

217
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:41,309
 it should be zero outside

218
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,290
 of the epsilon ball and

219
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:45,010
 inside it should be the same

220
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:46,170
 exponential function.

221
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:48,790
 Therefore, also inside the

222
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,489
 exponential function we have

223
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,070
 to divide by epsilon.

224
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:53,970
 And then you see this was

225
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,540
 just scaling the whole test

226
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:56,070
 function.

227
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:58,010
 Everything looks exactly

228
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:59,839
 the same just zoom to

229
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,160
 the epsilon ball instead of

230
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,070
 the unit ball.

231
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:02,670
 OK.

232
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:04,450
 Then let's calculate with

233
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:05,480
 this test function

234
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:07,869
 by assumption this integral

235
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,420
 here is given by the delta

236
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:11,029
 distribution which means

237
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,380
 it gives us the value of

238
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,940
 the test function at zero.

239
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,700
 It's a positive number.

240
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,299
 Hence, we don't change anything

241
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:18,869
 when we use absolute values

242
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,420
 here, it makes everything

243
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:21,790
 easier because we can just

244
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,640
 apply the triangle inequality

245
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:24,799
 for integrals.

246
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:26,470
 So now we have the absolute

247
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,929
 value inside the

248
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,640
 integral.

249
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,239
 This means that we can just

250
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,019
 pull out the supreme norm

251
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:33,119
 of the test function.

252
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:34,970
 However, before we do that,

253
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,260
 we should change the region

254
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:38,040
 where we integrate over to

255
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:39,049
 the epsilon ball.

256
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:41,170
 Because outside of the epsilon

257
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:42,609
 ball, everything is zero

258
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:43,890
 by the test function.

259
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:45,559
 And maybe now you already

260
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,239
 see why we care so much about

261
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,160
 the epsilon ball.

262
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,829
 First, let's pull out the

263
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,130
 supremum norm of the test

264
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,779
 function.

265
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:53,630
 And then you see only this

266
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,250
 integral here remains

267
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,279
 first, the supremum here

268
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,660
 we already know it's the

269
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,149
 value at zero more

270
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,690
 concretely the same as the

271
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,609
 left hand side.

272
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,660
 And the second part here

273
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,079
 is equal to B

274
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,339
 however, B was smaller

275
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,339
 than one half, which

276
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,220
 means we have an inequality

277
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:14,000
 which can't be satisfied.

278
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,019
 So we have a positive number

279
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:17,820
 which does not get smaller

280
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:19,059
 when we multiply it with

281
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,799
 one half.

282
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,609
 And such a positive real

283
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:23,369
 number does not exist.

284
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:25,769
 And this is indeed our wanted

285
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,440
 contradiction in

286
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,190
 conclusion such a locally

287
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,869
 integral function F for the

288
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,559
 delta distribution does not

289
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,239
 exist.

290
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,570
 Therefore, the delta distribution

291
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:36,769
 is not a regular

292
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:37,670
 distribution.

293
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:38,320
 OK.

294
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:39,480
 Then in the next video, I

295
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:40,609
 will show you what we can

296
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:42,220
 really do with distributions

297
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,399
 and how to calculate with

298
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:43,980
 them.

299
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:45,149
 Therefore, I hope I see you

300
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,480
 there and have a nice day.

301
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:47,160
 Bye.
