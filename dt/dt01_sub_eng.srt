00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,720
 Hello and welcome to new

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,059
 video series where I want

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,489
 to show you an introduction

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,769
 into the theory of

5
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,769
 distributions

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,239
 Here,

7
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,939
 In part one, I want to start

8
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:12,340
 with the motivation for this

9
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:12,979
 new topic.

10
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:15,920
 When you start with real

11
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,520
 analysis, then you learn

12
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,319
 a lot of important concepts.

13
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,889
 For example, you learn what

14
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:23,510
 a function is, you learn

15
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,729
 what a limit is.

16
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,559
 And most importantly, you

17
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:28,399
 learn what a derivative is

18
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,659
 with these objects, you can

19
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,099
 already do a lot of

20
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,060
 mathematics.

21
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,599
 But in the end, you will

22
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,049
 reach other fields for

23
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,740
 example, differential

24
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,639
 equations

25
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,099
 for Fourier series

26
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,090
 and even the Fourier

27
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:44,930
 transform.

28
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:48,369
 And now here the problems

29
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,150
 begin because

30
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:52,110
 for differential equations

31
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,889
 also some solutions

32
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,419
 with sharp turns are

33
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,889
 interesting and important.

34
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,060
 And there you already know

35
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:01,299
 that the notion of a

36
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,180
 derivative is in some

37
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:04,940
 sense, too strong to

38
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,779
 consider functions with sharp

39
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,449
 turns because at a

40
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:10,150
 sharp turn, the function

41
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,580
 is not differentiable.

42
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,459
 Therefore, we need something

43
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,250
 new that can also deal with

44
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,389
 such solutions.

45
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,139
 So we would say we need

46
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,699
 something that can deal with

47
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:22,169
 more general solutions.

48
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:23,970
 OK.

49
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,690
 We will talk about this later

50
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,319
 Here,

51
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,790
 I want to start with an

52
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,349
 example and indeed, it's

53
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,750
 a very famous example.

54
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,360
 It goes back to the year

55
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,279
 1927

56
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,449
 and to Paul Dirac,

57
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,489
 what he wanted was a derivative

58
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,389
 of a function.

59
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,879
 And we used letter H 

60
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:45,610
 because this function is

61
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,129
 most of the time known as

62
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:48,370
 the Heaviside function.

63
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:51,330
 In spite of having this fancy

64
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:53,139
 name, the function is indeed

65
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,099
 very simple.

66
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:57,699
 It is just zero on the

67
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:59,669
 negative axis and

68
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,279
 one on the positive

69
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:01,860
 axis.

70
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:05,510
 And now Dirac wanted

71
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,029
 to have a derivative of this

72
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,699
 function.

73
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,710
 And you see this is no

74
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,649
 problem at all outside

75
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,389
 of zero.

76
00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:14,240
 But in zero, there is a

77
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:14,750
 jump.

78
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,169
 Hence, in the classical way,

79
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,009
 we have a problem at this

80
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,770
 one point.

81
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,119
 Now Dirac wanted a more

82
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,889
 general derivative and he

83
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:27,850
 called this one the delta

84
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,449
 function.

85
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,699
 Now more general here means

86
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,869
 of course, it is a

87
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,339
 generalization of the

88
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,589
 classical notion of a

89
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,380
 derivative.

90
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,330
 Hence, we can conclude that

91
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:40,940
 this new delta function

92
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,429
 has to be zero

93
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,240
 outside of this

94
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,050
 critical point X equals to

95
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:46,630
 zero.

96
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,779
 However, Dirac also

97
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:54,509
 wanted that the fundamental

98
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,440
 theorem of calculus still

99
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:57,910
 holds for this new function

100
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,949
 more concretely.

101
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,669
 This means we can write

102
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:04,500
 down for an arbitrarily

103
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:05,910
 small epsilon

104
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,570
 the following integral 

105
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,660
 which is just an

106
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:12,589
 integration around zero

107
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,759
 for a delta function.

108
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,759
 But now we know this is the

109
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,509
 derivative of the Heaviside 

110
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,419
 function.

111
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:19,949
 So we can put in

112
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,820
 the derivative of H here.

113
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,080
 And now if the fundamental

114
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:28,940
 theorem of calculus holds

115
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,750
 for these functions here

116
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,690
 we have of

117
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,830
 epsilon

118
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:34,869
 minus

119
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:37,229
 H of minus epsilon.

120
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:40,289
 Now, looking at the graph,

121
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,149
 we recognize that this is

122
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,949
 always one on the right hand

123
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,889
 side and always zero

124
00:03:45,899 --> 00:03:46,990
 on the other side.

125
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,130
 So we have one minus zero

126
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:51,020
 or in other words, always

127
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:51,389
 one.

128
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:55,470
 Now this may look

129
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,240
 nice, but we

130
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,229
 already know that if we

131
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,039
 have these two things together,

132
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,080
 this delta can't be an

133
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:04,270
 ordinary function.

134
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:06,610
 Please recall.

135
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:08,339
 This first part tells

136
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,009
 us that delta

137
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,320
 is zero

138
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,750
 except for one

139
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,330
 point.

140
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:14,779
 So in our language, this

141
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:16,529
 would mean delta

142
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,119
 is zero almost

143
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:18,809
 everywhere.

144
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:21,628
 To be more concrete, I would

145
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,598
 say this holds with

146
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:25,359
 respect to the Lebesgue measure.

147
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,660
 And from this, we can conclude

148
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,589
 that every integral for

149
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,140
 this function has to be

150
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:33,690
 zero.

151
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,190
 In particular, the integral

152
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,160
 from before.

153
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,010
 So minus epsilon to

154
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,589
 epsilon of delta

155
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,339
 X is also

156
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,209
 zero for all epsilon,

157
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:49,619
 which means it can't be

158
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,329
 one as we wanted

159
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:52,029
 before.

160
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,190
 So here's our contradiction.

161
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,609
 Now it gets even worse

162
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:00,390
 because Dirac does not stop

163
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:00,929
 there.

164
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:01,359
 Dirac

165
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,589
 also wants to calculate with

166
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,929
 the derivatives of this new

167
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,890
 delta function.

168
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:09,140
 And now we see at this point,

169
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,750
 we have to put a

170
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,420
 meaning into the symbols

171
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:12,730
 here.

172
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:16,209
 In order to do this, we

173
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,589
 will define a new

174
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,589
 object and call this a

175
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,510
 distribution.

176
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,429
 And in the end, delta

177
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,269
 will be such a distribution.

178
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:26,390
 For the reasons you have

179
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,250
 seen above, we want to

180
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,839
 calculate as we have

181
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,350
 ordinary functions, this

182
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:33,320
 new notion distribution is

183
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:35,200
 also often called a

184
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,510
 generalized function.

185
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:38,899
 The overall idea for

186
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,540
 distributions is that we

187
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,480
 see these objects as

188
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:43,480
 densities.

189
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,769
 So here you should

190
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,670
 visualize a one

191
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,250
 dimensional rode or

192
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,190
 one dimensional bar

193
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:52,459
 where we have a mass

194
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,239
 density.

195
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,269
 Now, in this picture, the

196
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,640
 delta distribution or the

197
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,250
 delta function would be a

198
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,140
 singular density.

199
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:02,899
 So a density where

200
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,730
 all the mass is one

201
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,279
 point.

202
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:07,750
 OK.

203
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,510
 So let's do a picture for

204
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,670
 this visualization.

205
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,929
 The curve of an ordinary

206
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,859
 function may look like this.

207
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,000
 Now you should see this as

208
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,760
 the mass distribution

209
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:22,769
 on this one dimensional rode

210
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:23,149
 here.

211
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:25,989
 And this means here

212
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,709
 we have a high density

213
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,489
 and at this point, we have

214
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,559
 a low density.

215
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:33,630
 Now for finding the

216
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,600
 density in the real world,

217
00:06:35,609 --> 00:06:36,850
 you would use a measurement

218
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:38,850
 device in

219
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:40,549
 mathematics, we then use

220
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:42,440
 so called test functions.

221
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:45,750
 So functions phi that

222
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,109
 should be nice enough.

223
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:48,929
 So at least continuous and

224
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,529
 localized in some sense

225
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,230
 for me, that means they are

226
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,149
 zero except for one

227
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,190
 small bump.

228
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,200
 And that's the region you

229
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:58,779
 measure in.

230
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:02,040
 Now, in order to find the

231
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:03,779
 mass in that region, we have

232
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,200
 to calculate an integral.

233
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:06,649
 So an integral over

234
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,239
 R function

235
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,059
 f and function

236
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,480
 Phi

237
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:16,119
 here we get out a real number

238
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,839
 which describes

239
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,839
 our density

240
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:22,089
 here in that region.

241
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:24,269
 Yeah, roughly in that way.

242
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:28,570
 And now the idea is that

243
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:30,089
 we use a lot of these

244
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,260
 small bumps.

245
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,760
 So we get out a lot of real

246
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:33,679
 numbers.

247
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,950
 In other words, we have a

248
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,619
 map that maps

249
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,720
 all the phis to

250
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,359
 these real numbers given

251
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:41,149
 by the integral.

252
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,149
 Or in other words, instead

253
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,640
 of looking at the function

254
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:47,410
 F itself, we can

255
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,359
 just look at the collection

256
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,970
 of all these real

257
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,839
 numbers here.

258
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,679
 Indeed, that is what we will

259
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,100
 do in the next videos, we

260
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,410
 will substitute the function

261
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,329
 F with this linear

262
00:07:59,339 --> 00:07:59,890
 map.

263
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,920
 Now, the big advantage of

264
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:04,720
 this is of course, that

265
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,440
 now we can also deal with

266
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,160
 this strange delta function.

267
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,750
 Obviously, we can't draw

268
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,239
 a graph for this delta

269
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,809
 function because it's not

270
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,799
 an ordinary function.

271
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:17,709
 However, we have our

272
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,260
 visualization that it is

273
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:20,649
 a point mass.

274
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,630
 So this means it is zero

275
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,299
 except for one point

276
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,519
 and we have put that point

277
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:27,440
 in zero.

278
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:29,589
 So here we have a jump

279
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,320
 and this jump should be

280
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:32,510
 infinitely high.

281
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,328
 So what does this mean?

282
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:38,179
 Yeah, it means if you want

283
00:08:38,188 --> 00:08:40,049
 to measure with our test

284
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:41,688
 functions, you get

285
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:43,568
 out the value of the test

286
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:45,198
 function at this one

287
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:45,828
 point.

288
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:51,039
 So this makes sense for our

289
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:52,960
 measurement devices here.

290
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:55,390
 And also for the integral

291
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,080
 we have seen before for the

292
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:57,919
 delta function.

293
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,450
 Indeed, we generalize this

294
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,559
 integral here.

295
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,440
 So now we want to put in

296
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,929
 a new function, delta

297
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,179
 function instead of f

298
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,179
 but we learn we can't see

299
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,960
 that as a real integral.
 
300
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,830
 What we have indeed is a

301
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,000
 generalization of this

302
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,989
 concept to this linear

303
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,359
 map.

304
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,890
 Well, I think that's good

305
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,890
 enough for today.

306
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,130
 So now you see the

307
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,590
 motivation for

308
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,659
 distributions.

309
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:27,270
 And in the next video, I

310
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,739
 will give the exact

311
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,210
 definition of such a

312
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:30,969
 distribution.

313
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:33,840
 This means that we will learn

314
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:35,440
 what the test functions are

315
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,169
 actually and also

316
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:38,750
 what this linear map then

317
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,260
 is

318
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:42,479
 then thank you very much

319
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:43,760
 for listening and see you

320
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,440
 next time.

321
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:45,510
 Bye.
