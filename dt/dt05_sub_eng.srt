00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,170
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,089
 distributions.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,659
 And as always many, many

4
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,219
 thanks to all the nice people

5
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,530
 that support this channel

6
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:08,890
 on Steady or paypal.

7
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,550
 This is part five.

8
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,750
 And today I want to talk

9
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,359
 about so called regular

10
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:14,260
 distributions.

11
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:16,680
 However, before we do this,

12
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:18,010
 I first want to show you

13
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,569
 a useful characterization

14
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:20,590
 for distributions.

15
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,200
 Of course, you already know

16
00:00:23,209 --> 00:00:24,799
 a distribution is a linear

17
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:26,770
 map T from the space of

18
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,840
 test functions

19
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,600
 to the real or complex numbers.

20
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,939
 And you also know it has

21
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,529
 to be continuous in the

22
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,840
 sense as we define it.

23
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:37,740
 In the last video, we

24
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,099
 use sequences for this.

25
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,189
 But there are also a lot

26
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,459
 of other equivalent

27
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,759
 characterizations for it.

28
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,139
 Hence, we can write it in

29
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,040
 the following way T is a

30
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:49,009
 distribution if and only

31
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,819
 if for all

32
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,650
 compact sets in RN,

33
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:55,189
 there exists a natural number

34
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,979
 M which could be zero

35
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,770
 and there exists a positive

36
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:00,959
 constant C

37
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,270
 such that for all test

38
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:04,319
 functions, Phi

39
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,870
 we have that if the

40
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,349
 support of Phi

41
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,269
 lies in the compact set

42
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,260
 K, then this

43
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:14,010
 implies that the value

44
00:01:14,029 --> 00:01:15,620
 T of Phi is

45
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:16,809
 bounded from above,

46
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,160
 namely we have the constant

47
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:20,809
 C times the sum

48
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,529
 over all multi indices

49
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,480
 with degree less or equal

50
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:25,599
 than the constant M.

51
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,589
 And then we look at all the

52
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,440
 derivatives of Phi in the

53
00:01:29,449 --> 00:01:30,400
 supremum norm.

54
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:33,010
 Please note this means that

55
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:34,449
 whenever you can write down

56
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:36,330
 such an estimate, you immediately

57
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:38,330
 have the continuity and therefore

58
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:39,809
 you have a distribution T

59
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,959
 since at first, it looks

60
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,620
 complicated, we really should

61
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:44,769
 write down a proof for it.

62
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,800
 So let's start with this

63
00:01:46,809 --> 00:01:47,449
 direction.

64
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:49,099
 So when we have the estimate,

65
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,519
 what can we say about

66
00:01:50,529 --> 00:01:52,489
 continuity in

67
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,680
 order to show this, let's

68
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,260
 choose test functions Phi

69
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:57,220
 K and Phi such that we have

70
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,129
 our D convergence for the

71
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:00,779
 sequence Phi K to

72
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,769
 Phi, then we know by

73
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:04,660
 definition there is a compact

74
00:02:04,669 --> 00:02:06,379
 or bounded set K in

75
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:08,330
 RN such that the

76
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:10,020
 support of all phi K

77
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,929
 lies in this compact set

78
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,330
 K.

79
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,919
 And we also know that for

80
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:16,729
 all multi indices alpha,

81
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,570
 we have that the divers

82
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,039
 D alpha Phi K

83
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,759
 converge in the suprema

84
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,330
 norm.

85
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,300
 Please keep in mind this

86
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:25,839
 was just the explanation

87
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,479
 what the D-convergence here

88
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:27,970
 means.

89
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,169
 OK.

90
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,630
 And now we just have to check

91
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,529
 if T of Phi K is

92
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:34,529
 convergent to T of Phi.

93
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,679
 In other words, we want that

94
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,679
 this term goes to zero.

95
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,320
 When K goes to infinity.

96
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,899
 By using the linearity, we

97
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,889
 can rewrite that as T of

98
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:46,860
 Phi K minus Phi.

99
00:02:47,649 --> 00:02:49,149
 Of course, we know this is

100
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,500
 again a test function with

101
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:51,639
 support at K.

102
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:53,119
 So we know they exist in

103
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,940
 M and in C such that this

104
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:55,949
 estimate holds.

105
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:57,889
 And there you see, we have

106
00:02:57,899 --> 00:02:59,300
 what we want because this

107
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:01,179
 term goes to zero when K

108
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,179
 goes to infinity.

109
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,339
 And please don't forget we

110
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,669
 have a finite sum here.

111
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:07,770
 So this is all we needed

112
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:09,089
 to show for the first part.

113
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,429
 Now let's go from the left

114
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,669
 hand side to the right hand

115
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:12,020
 side.

116
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,059
 Here, I want to do a proof

117
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,100
 by contraposition.

118
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,910
 So we start with the negation

119
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,059
 of the right hand side.

120
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:20,369
 This means that we just have

121
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,860
 to exchange the quantifier.

122
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,660
 So here we have, there exists

123
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:25,619
 a compact set such that for

124
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,029
 all M and all

125
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,740
 C there exists a

126
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,949
 test function phi

127
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:32,320
 and the negation of the implication

128
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,789
 is just that the support

129
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,110
 is still in K.

130
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:37,029
 But the inequality goes the

131
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,789
 other way around this

132
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,179
 means that we have a greater

133
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,139
 sign here.

134
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,619
 So this is our assumption

135
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,779
 and where we want to get

136
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:46,649
 to is that T is

137
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,699
 not continuous.

138
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,839
 Now, we call this whole thing

139
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,130
 means there is a compact

140
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:52,720
 set but then no matter

141
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:54,440
 which M and C we choose,

142
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:56,149
 we always find a corresponding

143
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,600
 Phi.

144
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:58,669
 Therefore, let's go through

145
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:00,160
 all the natural numbers K

146
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:01,979
 for C and M and take the

147
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,380
 corresponding phi k.

148
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,820
 This means that we have T

149
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,729
 phi K greater than K

150
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,610
 times the sum where we have

151
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:10,050
 here.

152
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:11,320
 The maximum order for the

153
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,619
 derivatives as k

154
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:15,100
 please don't forget the absolute

155
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,519
 value around a multi

156
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,250
 index just means that you

157
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,040
 add up all the components.

158
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:22,588
 So no matter how you combine

159
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:24,299
 all the partial derivatives,

160
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:25,848
 the maximum order you get

161
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:27,118
 out is always key.

162
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:29,609
 Also important to note is

163
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:31,140
 that we have the zero multi

164
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,130
 index as well in the sum,

165
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,779
 which means we have the supremum

166
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,420
 norm of Phi K here.

167
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:38,559
 Now, the key idea of the

168
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,910
 proof is that we define a

169
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,829
 new test function Phi

170
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,640
 K by scaling the

171
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:44,359
 Phi case.

172
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:46,720
 And of course, the correct

173
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,619
 scaling factor is exactly

174
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,500
 one over the absolute value

175
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,839
 of T of Phi k

176
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:54,279
 because we know it's increasing

177
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,179
 with K and it increases

178
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,179
 faster than the supremum

179
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,230
 norm of Phi K.

180
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:02,049
 Therefore, by this definition,

181
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:03,339
 the psi K go

182
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,269
 uniformly to the zero function

183
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,989
 when K tends to infinity.

184
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,339
 In fact, the whole argument

185
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,250
 works for every multi index

186
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:13,200
 which means we have the uniform

187
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:14,630
 convergence for every

188
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,359
 derivative

189
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,890
 combining this with the supports

190
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:19,480
 being all in K.

191
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,029
 We have indeed the D

192
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,929
 convergence.

193
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,829
 However, now you might already

194
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,660
 see the images under

195
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,279
 T don't converge to

196
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,220
 zero to see this.

197
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,359
 Just look at the absolute

198
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:32,010
 value of T of Phi

199
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:32,640
 K

200
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:35,269
 which is by the linearity

201
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,910
 just one over the absolute

202
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,510
 value of T of Phi

203
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,160
 K times the absolute

204
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,750
 value of T of Phi

205
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,549
 K, which is of

206
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,140
 course always one.

207
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:47,829
 In other words, it does not

208
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,029
 converge to zero.

209
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,500
 Now this simply means the

210
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,359
 linear map T is not

211
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:55,279
 continuous and that

212
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,350
 is what we wanted to show

213
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:57,200
 from the beginning.

214
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:58,690
 So our proof is finished

215
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,019
 with this technical proposition.

216
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,679
 Out of the way we can go

217
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,500
 to the definition of a regular

218
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,339
 distribution.

219
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:07,209
 For this, we first need a

220
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,000
 notion of a locally

221
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,339
 integrable function.

222
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,239
 Let's call the function F

223
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,640
 and it can have values in

224
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:14,769
 R or in C

225
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,040
 and we call it locally

226
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:18,869
 integral if the function

227
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,459
 is integrable, when we

228
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,239
 restrict it to any compact

229
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:22,670
 set.

230
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,179
 So you can put it in the

231
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,119
 way that the integral over

232
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,019
 compact set K of the

233
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:29,920
 function F with the absolute

234
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:31,269
 value makes

235
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,540
 sense and is

236
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:33,299
 finite.

237
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,260
 When you know how to deal

238
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,619
 with Lebesgue integrals, it

239
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,019
 will make your life much

240
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:39,579
 easier here because you

241
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:41,380
 know, you need a measurable

242
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,859
 function F and the

243
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,420
 integral should be finite.

244
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,500
 However, it's also possible

245
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,980
 to think of a normal Riemann

246
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:49,750
 integral here and do everything

247
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,950
 with the Riemann integral.

248
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,399
 But then of course, we don't

249
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,130
 get out the full general

250
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,820
 result.

251
00:06:55,369 --> 00:06:57,100
 Therefore, I would say knowing

252
00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:58,890
 some measure theory and the

253
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,500
 Lebesgue integral is indeed

254
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,959
 helpful here in the theory

255
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:02,980
 of distributions.

256
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,279
 Now, for such locally integrable

257
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,239
 functions, we use a common

258
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,890
 notation, namely we

259
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:10,850
 write a curved L

260
00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:12,500
 with one and lo

261
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,850
 and often we put in the domain

262
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:17,529
 which is here

263
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,339
 and please

264
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,019
 note of course, all

265
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,859
 integrable functions are also

266
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:24,200
 locally integrable.

267
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,140
 We just have more functions

268
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:26,579
 here.

269
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,619
 For example, if you consider

270
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,380
 the function F which sends

271
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,820
 R to R

272
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,519
 and X to X squared, then

273
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:35,779
 this function is not

274
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,779
 integrable because the integral

275
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,170
 over the whole domain are

276
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:40,279
 would be infinity.

277
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,529
 However, it's locally

278
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,019
 integrable because it's a

279
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:45,369
 continuous function.

280
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:47,190
 And when we integrate over

281
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,059
 a bounded set here, we don't

282
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,299
 have any problem, we get

283
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:51,839
 out a finite integral.

284
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,230
 Nevertheless, please note

285
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:56,149
 that we don't need the continuity

286
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,540
 for a locally integrable

287
00:07:57,549 --> 00:07:58,119
 function.

288
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:00,070
 We have much more functions

289
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,440
 here than just the continuous

290
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:01,869
 ones.

291
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,040
 Now, the nice thing we want

292
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:05,619
 to do now with such a function

293
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,489
 is to define a distribution

294
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,869
 for such a function F I want

295
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,820
 to use the notation TF

296
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:13,700
 for the corresponding distribution.

297
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,320
 And it is defined for test

298
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,279
 function Phi.

299
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,559
 And you might already know

300
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,109
 this because we did it for

301
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,559
 continuous functions in the

302
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,200
 last video by the

303
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:24,079
 integral

304
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:25,890
 FX phi

305
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:27,390
 XDX.

306
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,420
 This is a well defined

307
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:31,140
 distribution because the

308
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:32,739
 integral is actually

309
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,510
 just an integral over a compact

310
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,500
 set, namely the support of

311
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,390
 Phi, it's also

312
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,250
 linear and it fulfills our

313
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,679
 estimate from the beginning.

314
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,690
 This one we really should

315
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,409
 write down.

316
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:45,690
 So we have the absolute value

317
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,510
 of T f phi, we can

318
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,070
 pull in the absolute value

319
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,070
 into the integral and we

320
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,030
 can also easily split

321
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,469
 it up.

322
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:56,419
 Now instead of RN, we can

323
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:58,210
 just write the support of

324
00:08:58,219 --> 00:09:00,049
 Phi simply because

325
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:01,469
 outside of function, Phi

326
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:03,140
 is zero, which has no

327
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,780
 contribution to the integral.

328
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,169
 Also we know we can estimate

329
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,809
 this one with the suprema

330
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:09,859
 norm of Phi,

331
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,400
 hence, we have the integral

332
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:13,969
 of F in the absolute

333
00:09:13,979 --> 00:09:14,549
 value

334
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,260
 times the sup norm of

335
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:17,710
 Phi.

336
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:20,109
 Of course, we can integrate

337
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:22,070
 here over any compact set

338
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,049
 K as long as it is a

339
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:25,789
 superset of the support of

340
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,260
 Phi.

341
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,500
 Now please remember what

342
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,979
 the estimate is we want to

343
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:30,419
 show.

344
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,140
 So I put it here in a

345
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,539
 box as a reminder.

346
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:36,349
 And there you see the

347
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:38,169
 integral here is the constant

348
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:38,950
 C here.

349
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,039
 And the sum is just the sum

350
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:42,349
 where M is zero.

351
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:44,030
 So we just have the suprema

352
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,909
 number Phi in

353
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,619
 other words, we have indeed

354
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,539
 a distribution.

355
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,849
 So you see this is similar

356
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:52,270
 to what we had in the last

357
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,729
 video where we considered

358
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:55,349
 continuous functions.

359
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,830
 The distribution here is

360
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,469
 essentially given by a

361
00:09:58,479 --> 00:09:59,770
 normal function F.

362
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,960
 And therefore, these

363
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,619
 distributions are just called

364
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,179
 regular distributions.

365
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,630
 To put this into a definition,

366
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,159
 you would say a distribution

367
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:11,070
 T is called regular

368
00:10:11,789 --> 00:10:13,150
 if there is a locally

369
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,909
 integrable function F

370
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,840
 such that T is the

371
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,450
 same as TF

372
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,729
 so the linear map T can

373
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:22,479
 actually be written as an

374
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,080
 integral in this sense.

375
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,669
 So you could say these are

376
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,200
 the distributions that behave

377
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,099
 like normal functions as

378
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:31,039
 we already know it.

379
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,090
 But we also know there are

380
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,710
 much more distributions than

381
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:35,020
 that.

382
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:37,760
 Indeed, the delta distribution

383
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,979
 is not regular.

384
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,419
 And we can show this in the

385
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:41,210
 next video.

386
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,289
 Therefore, I hope I see you

387
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:44,909
 there and have a nice day.

388
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:45,669
 Bye.
