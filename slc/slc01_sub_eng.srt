00:00:00,409 --> 00:00:02,029
 Hello and welcome to

2
00:00:02,039 --> 00:00:03,710
 start learning complex

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,489
 numbers, a video course where

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,190
 I introduce you to the field

5
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:08,550
 of complex numbers.

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,369
 So I want to show you how

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,180
 we can construct these numbers

8
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:13,270
 and how we can calculate

9
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:13,819
 with them.

10
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:15,670
 However, before we do that,

11
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,180
 I first want to thank all

12
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,569
 the nice people that support

13
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:19,979
 this channel on Steady or

14
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:20,620
 paypal.

15
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:22,510
 Now, the starting point for

16
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,069
 the complex numbers is the

17
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,760
 real number line R

18
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:26,610
 there.

19
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,239
 You should know we find all

20
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,809
 integers on the number line,

21
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:31,809
 all fractions but also

22
00:00:31,819 --> 00:00:33,209
 irrational numbers like the

23
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,169
 square root of two.

24
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,639
 Moreover, we also know that

25
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,279
 we have two operations, the

26
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,180
 addition and the multiplication

27
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,939
 and we know that they fulfill

28
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,330
 a lot of rules such that

29
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,159
 we call R a field.

30
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,400
 Then we also have an ordering

31
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:49,259
 so we can compare two numbers

32
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,400
 and this ordering also

33
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:53,119
 satisfies some rules.

34
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:54,680
 Finally, the last

35
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,520
 property is the completeness

36
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:57,770
 which tells us that there

37
00:00:57,779 --> 00:00:59,560
 are no holes on this number

38
00:00:59,569 --> 00:00:59,919
 line.

39
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,049
 OK.

40
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,689
 Then let's discuss what one

41
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,680
 can do with these real numbers

42
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,050
 here.

43
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,449
 For example, we can say

44
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,050
 that we are able to solve

45
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:10,279
 a lot of equations

46
00:01:11,089 --> 00:01:12,959
 solving X plus five

47
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,860
 is equal to one is no

48
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,760
 problem at all.

49
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,800
 In the same way, we can also

50
00:01:17,809 --> 00:01:19,760
 solve X times five

51
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:20,819
 is equal to one.

52
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,709
 So here you can see we can

53
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,080
 use the property that we

54
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:24,940
 have a field.

55
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,830
 Then another equation we

56
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:28,819
 solved is X squared is

57
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,860
 equal to two.

58
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,050
 This one leads to the square

59
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,050
 of two which is in R

60
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:35,370
 by completeness.

61
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,889
 However, this does not mean

62
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,209
 that we are able to solve

63
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,680
 any quadratic equation.

64
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:42,510
 For example, the quadratic

65
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,279
 equation X squared is

66
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,089
 equal to minus one

67
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,809
 has no solutions.

68
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,339
 This is not hard to see because

69
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:52,089
 you can show that any

70
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:53,839
 square in the real numbers

71
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:55,250
 is greater or equal than

72
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:55,800
 zero.

73
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,150
 And we also need that minus

74
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,830
 one is less than

75
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:00,410
 zero.

76
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,459
 Here, I can tell you if you

77
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,949
 just work with the axioms

78
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,370
 of the real numbers, it's

79
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:06,989
 a good exercise to show

80
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,229
 both of these things.

81
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:10,967
 Then this implies that this

82
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,369
 simple equation does not

83
00:02:12,378 --> 00:02:13,479
 have any solution.

84
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,740
 However, for us, it makes

85
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,490
 sense that we extend our

86
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,179
 numbers such that this

87
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,820
 equation has solutions.

88
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,429
 The first thing you should

89
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,380
 note here is that X squared

90
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:26,089
 is nothing else than X

91
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,889
 times X.

92
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,429
 I say that because the same

93
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,100
 equation with the addition

94
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:32,270
 is solvable.

95
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:34,070
 So surprisingly, the

96
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,869
 addition and the multiplication

97
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,570
 act differently in R

98
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,070
 which also has something

99
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,669
 to do with the ordering.

100
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,910
 Hence, our idea is to

101
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,880
 expand the number set such

102
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:46,669
 that we can solve such equations.

103
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:47,119
 Here.

104
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,759
 But we already know that

105
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,369
 we can't conserve all the

106
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,350
 properties in R in

107
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,589
 order to see what we can

108
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,020
 do.

109
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,470
 Let's look at the number

110
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,190
 line again.

111
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:57,860
 First, let's fill in the

112
00:02:57,869 --> 00:02:59,580
 number 02

113
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:00,419
 and four.

114
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,300
 Now, you know, we can go

115
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:04,229
 from 2 to 4 just by

116
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,880
 using multiplication, we

117
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:07,619
 simply multiply by two.

118
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:09,399
 However, the interesting

119
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,080
 thing is now that we can

120
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:12,779
 split this big jump

121
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:14,550
 into small jumps,

122
00:03:15,089 --> 00:03:17,070
 we just multiply by a number

123
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,399
 that is a little bit bigger

124
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,119
 than one.

125
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,020
 You see the smaller the one

126
00:03:21,029 --> 00:03:22,979
 jump is the more jumps we

127
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,339
 need.

128
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,460
 OK.

129
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,059
 The splitting up does not

130
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,630
 work when we want to jump

131
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,869
 to minus two.

132
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,080
 For this big jump, we have

133
00:03:31,089 --> 00:03:32,880
 to multiply by minus

134
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:33,309
 one.

135
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,750
 Also interesting here, if

136
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,619
 we multiply again by minus

137
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,300
 one, we get back to

138
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:39,660
 two.

139
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,669
 So here you see multiplying

140
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,380
 with a negative number is

141
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:45,820
 different than multiplying

142
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,110
 with a positive number

143
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:48,990
 because in the first case,

144
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,690
 we immediately change the

145
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,059
 side of the number line.

146
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,509
 Now looking back to the splitting

147
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,710
 of the jump for positive

148
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,600
 numbers here, we can see

149
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,880
 the equation from above

150
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,490
 because doing two jumps

151
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,419
 with the number X means

152
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:05,240
 we have X squared is

153
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,199
 equal to two.

154
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,729
 So exactly this equation

155
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,389
 where we know we have a solution.

156
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,889
 Now you might see the problem.

157
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:14,500
 How can we split up this

158
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:16,238
 jump into two parts?

159
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,510
 By looking at this picture,

160
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:20,369
 you might already see we

161
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,839
 could just add another

162
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,220
 direction for the numbers.

163
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:25,600
 Therefore, the idea is that

164
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:27,429
 we also include a Y

165
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,880
 axis.

166
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,760
 Now here

167
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,459
 jumping from one to

168
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,220
 minus one is still

169
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,040
 given by multiplying with

170
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:36,019
 minus one.

171
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,000
 However, now we are able

172
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,850
 to split it up into smaller

173
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:41,320
 parts, for

174
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:43,239
 example, into two parts where

175
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,119
 we multiply with the number

176
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:45,720
 X.

177
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,859
 And there you see this is

178
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:49,299
 our equation from before

179
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,279
 X squared is equal to

180
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,140
 minus one.

181
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,339
 Hence you see the number

182
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,200
 we search for is this

183
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:57,720
 point in the plane.

184
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,100
 So we need a new name for

185
00:05:00,109 --> 00:05:00,890
 this number.

186
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,529
 We call it I.

187
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,500
 Now with our picture in mind

188
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,279
 this I is now a special

189
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,739
 number because when we

190
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,170
 multiply I with

191
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:11,820
 itself, we get out the

192
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:13,809
 jump minus one or

193
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,290
 to put it.

194
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:15,640
 In other words, I

195
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,519
 squared is equal to

196
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:18,420
 minus one.

197
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:20,910
 And this is now the important

198
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,670
 formula we should remember

199
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:23,630
 all the time.

200
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:24,869
 OK.

201
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,760
 With all this, we have some

202
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:28,510
 idea what our goal is to

203
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,970
 expand the number set.

204
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,529
 And how we can reach that

205
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,489
 goal extending the

206
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,109
 number line into a second

207
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,690
 direction is of course a

208
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,049
 completely new idea.

209
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,149
 Therefore, we really have

210
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,670
 to do this in a formal way,

211
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,329
 what we can do in the next

212
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:45,239
 video in this way.

213
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,649
 I hope I see you there and

214
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,549
 have a nice day.

215
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,420
 Bye.
