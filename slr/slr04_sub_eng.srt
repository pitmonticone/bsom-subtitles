00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,089
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,099 --> 00:00:03,480
 start learning

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,250
 reals.

4
00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:05,889
 And as always, I want to

5
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,250
 thank all the nice people

6
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,369
 that support this channel

7
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,850
 on study or paypal.

8
00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:12,079
 In today's part four, I will

9
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,810
 show you how we can actually

10
00:00:13,819 --> 00:00:15,449
 construct the real numbers.

11
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,530
 This means that the starting

12
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,959
 point is the field of the

13
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:19,979
 rational numbers.

14
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:22,260
 And then we form a new field

15
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,049
 where every Cauchy sequence

16
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:25,590
 is actually convergent.

17
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:27,690
 Now because you have seen

18
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,889
 all the other number

19
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:30,270
 constructions, you might

20
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,709
 already guess that also

21
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,700
 here equivalence relations

22
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:34,590
 will be helpful.

23
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,150
 Our idea in this case should

24
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,770
 be that each point on the

25
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:40,189
 number line can be

26
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,090
 represented by a Cauchy

27
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:42,849
 sequence.

28
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,150
 For example, for the 0.1

29
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,630
 3rd, we can choose the

30
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:48,619
 sequence that has the

31
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,450
 members one third, one third

32
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:51,270
 and so on.

33
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:53,349
 So it's simply a constant

34
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,169
 sequence.

35
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,639
 Therefore, in particular

36
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,569
 a Cauchy sequence and also

37
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,889
 a convergence sequence.

38
00:00:59,419 --> 00:01:00,939
 However, the important part

39
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,529
 is that the limit is our

40
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,010
 0.1 3rd.

41
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,319
 Therefore, this infinite

42
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,650
 sequence of numbers

43
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,559
 represents one point on the

44
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,309
 number line.

45
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,669
 But now you should see that

46
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,669
 this representation can be

47
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,589
 in no way unique because

48
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,230
 we can just write down another

49
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,830
 sequence with the same limit.

50
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,220
 For example, we can just

51
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,199
 use decimals and start with

52
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,800
 0.3.

53
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,830
 Of course, you already know

54
00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:29,550
 this is just another notation

55
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:31,500
 for the fraction 3/10.

56
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:33,360
 And then the next member

57
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,589
 in the sequence should be

58
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,699
 0.33.

59
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,900
 With this, we just continue

60
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,169
 a pending threes.

61
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:41,370
 OK.

62
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:42,569
 With this, we have a well

63
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,129
 defined sequence where you

64
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:45,989
 can also easily check that

65
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,970
 it is also a Cauchy sequence.

66
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:49,620
 And because we get arbitrarily

67
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,849
 close to 1/3,

68
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,650
 eventually, we also know

69
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,230
 we have a conversion sequence

70
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,809
 with limit one third.

71
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:59,339
 So we can conclude when we

72
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:01,099
 form our equivalence classes

73
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,069
 soon, these two sequences

74
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,779
 here should land in one

75
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,639
 single box simply

76
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,059
 because they have the same

77
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,538
 limit.

78
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,699
 However, you already know

79
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,139
 we cannot just look at the

80
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:13,740
 limits because there are

81
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,880
 Cauchy sequences in Q

82
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:16,860
 without limits.

83
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:19,100
 Indeed, for this, we will

84
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,550
 find a simple solution.

85
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,419
 OK.

86
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:23,020
 The first step is to define

87
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:24,660
 the set of all the Cauchy

88
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:26,250
 sequences we consider.

89
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,729
 So here XN stands for a

90
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,259
 sequence which means an

91
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,580
 infinite list with the

92
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:33,449
 properties that

93
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,000
 for all natural numbers

94
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:36,990
 NXN is

95
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,050
 a rational number

96
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:40,130
 and that the sequence

97
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:41,779
 XN is indeed a Cauchy

98
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:42,779
 sequence.

99
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,509
 And this nice set that contains

100
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,270
 all the Koshy sequences

101
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,750
 is denoted by C.

102
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,320
 Now for two elements from

103
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,789
 the set, let's call them

104
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,479
 A and BN.

105
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,240
 So for two Cauchy

106
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,160
 sequences, we define

107
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,559
 an equivalence relation

108
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:00,729
 OK.

109
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,250
 At this point we want that

110
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:03,990
 these two sequences here

111
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,990
 are equivalent, but we don't

112
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,419
 want to use the explicit

113
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:07,940
 limit.

114
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:09,839
 Therefore, the question is

115
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,500
 here, how can we do that

116
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:13,350
 in a simple way for

117
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,770
 this?

118
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:15,490
 Let's imagine that we see

119
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,880
 all the sequence members

120
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:18,250
 here on the number line.

121
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:20,110
 In the case that the two

122
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:22,009
 Cauchy sequences, we present

123
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,289
 the same point, they

124
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,770
 accumulate around this

125
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:25,300
 number.

126
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:27,350
 So the sequence members get

127
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,000
 closer and closer to this

128
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:29,449
 point.

129
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,389
 Therefore, the difference

130
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,979
 between two members from

131
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,509
 the two sequences gets

132
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,910
 smaller and smaller.

133
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,360
 Hence, this difference is

134
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:39,779
 the new sequence we should

135
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:40,380
 consider.

136
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,639
 And now we already discussed

137
00:03:42,649 --> 00:03:44,259
 that it should be a convergence

138
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,080
 sequence with limit zero.

139
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,550
 In other words, for any point

140
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:50,009
 on the number line, we just

141
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,889
 shift the problem to zero.

142
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,110
 OK.

143
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,309
 Now we have everything we

144
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,029
 need because we can show

145
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,750
 that this defines indeed

146
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,990
 an equivalence relation.

147
00:03:59,529 --> 00:04:00,860
 This means that we can show

148
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:02,050
 the three properties.

149
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:03,850
 It's reflexive symmetric

150
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,750
 and transitive.

151
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:06,830
 Now, as always, when we have

152
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:08,250
 such a nice equivalence

153
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,990
 relation, we can go over

154
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,830
 to the boxes where we put

155
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:13,190
 in the equivalent Cauchy

156
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:13,960
 sequences.

157
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:16,089
 And we call these boxes

158
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,350
 equivalence classes

159
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,559
 by definition, the equivalence

160
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,279
 class of X and is

161
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,000
 just a set of all Cauchy

162
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,380
 sequences that are

163
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,690
 equivalent to XN.

164
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,079
 And therefore, this equivalence

165
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:29,440
 class now uniquely

166
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,119
 represents one point on the

167
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:31,920
 number line.

168
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,299
 To put it.

169
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:34,910
 In other words, we now can

170
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,540
 actually define the real

171
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:38,429
 numbers, the set

172
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,359
 R is just given by the

173
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:42,200
 set of all equivalence

174
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:42,760
 classes.

175
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,279
 So the set of these boxes

176
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,119
 defines the complete number

177
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:47,480
 line.

178
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,459
 Now, the only things that

179
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,660
 are still missing are the

180
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,160
 two operations, addition

181
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,700
 and multiplication and the

182
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:54,239
 ordering.

183
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,859
 Therefore, for the first

184
00:04:55,869 --> 00:04:57,500
 part, let's define how we

185
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,410
 can add two equivalence classes

186
00:04:59,420 --> 00:04:59,779
 here.

187
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:01,510
 Indeed, that's not hard at

188
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:01,899
 all.

189
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,529
 We can just use the addition

190
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,720
 we have for the rational

191
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,579
 numbers for all the members

192
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:07,829
 of the two sequences.

193
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,019
 Of course, as always, then

194
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:11,410
 we need to check that this

195
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,179
 definition does not depend

196
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,700
 on the chosen representation

197
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:16,170
 of the two occurrence classes.

198
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,179
 In this case, you just have

199
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,190
 to calculate a little bit

200
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,309
 with the sequences.

201
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,529
 And then we get out.

202
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,040
 Yes, it's well defined.

203
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,890
 And afterwards, you will

204
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,299
 believe me that everything

205
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:27,190
 works the same.

206
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,970
 When we define the multiplication,

207
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,339
 we just use again the well

208
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,690
 known multiplication for

209
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,579
 rational numbers.

210
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,850
 OK.

211
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:36,570
 Now looking back at the axioms

212
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:38,279
 we want to fulfill, you see

213
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,630
 that the last thing we need

214
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,480
 to define is an ordering.

215
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,649
 So we want to define in which

216
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,619
 cases one equivalence class

217
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,070
 is greater than another.

218
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:47,410
 One.

219
00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:48,529
 Of course.

220
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,869
 Here we need to use the

221
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,299
 ordering we have for the

222
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,450
 rational numbers again.

223
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,880
 However, claiming this for

224
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,679
 all sequence members is

225
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,100
 much too restrictive for

226
00:05:58,109 --> 00:05:59,799
 us to see this.

227
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:01,260
 Please keep the number line

228
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:01,799
 in mind.

229
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,320
 For example, our B and C

230
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:06,040
 could accumulate around

231
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:07,950
 one third and

232
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,700
 maybe the sequence with AM

233
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,350
 has zero as the limit.

234
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:13,929
 But of course, we have infinitely

235
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,510
 many sequence members here.

236
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,880
 Therefore, for example, a

237
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,739
 four could lie over here,

238
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:22,450
 but still the limit would

239
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:23,109
 be zero.

240
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,399
 Hence, this inequality

241
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,149
 here should be satisfied

242
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,470
 only eventually.

243
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,399
 In other words, we can just

244
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,959
 ignore finally many

245
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,600
 members.

246
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:34,609
 Therefore, we would write

247
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:36,369
 there exists a capital N

248
00:06:37,109 --> 00:06:38,940
 such that for all indices

249
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,820
 greater than capital N, we

250
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:42,579
 have A N is less

251
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:43,459
 than BN.

252
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,559
 OK.

253
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,239
 This now looks better, but

254
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,940
 it is still not correct.

255
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:50,100
 In order to see this, just

256
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,679
 imagine one point on a number

257
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,489
 line where the sequence BN

258
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,239
 comes from above and the

259
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,970
 sequence A comes from

260
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,559
 below.

261
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,500
 So they should describe the

262
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,179
 same point but this

263
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,720
 one is still fulfilled.

264
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,799
 Therefore, maybe it's better

265
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:06,329
 to think in distances.

266
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:07,720
 So let's bring this one to

267
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,720
 the other side, then it

268
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,500
 simply reads that BN

269
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,440
 minus A is greater than

270
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,000
 zero.

271
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,010
 Therefore, this means that

272
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,440
 the distance here could be

273
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,640
 arbitrary small.

274
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,239
 And when you look back at

275
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,929
 the first example here, that's

276
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,850
 not what we want.

277
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:25,239
 So there should be an actual

278
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,529
 minimal distance between

279
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,269
 the two points.

280
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,500
 And maybe we just call this

281
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,899
 distance simply

282
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:31,540
 delta.

283
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,809
 So we simply have to add,

284
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,500
 there exists a distance

285
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,369
 delta greater than zero.

286
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:39,649
 Of course, the distance delta

287
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,690
 could be very small.

288
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,369
 The point is it holds then

289
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,369
 for all end

290
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:44,910
 OK.

291
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,350
 There we have it, these are

292
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:47,929
 all the operations we need

293
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,029
 for the real numbers.

294
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:51,230
 Now, in the last step, one

295
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:52,890
 can just calculate that all

296
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:54,470
 the properties we want, the

297
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,170
 axioms are actually

298
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:56,910
 satisfied.

299
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,390
 For example, we can define

300
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,720
 the zero element and the

301
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,279
 one element and show that

302
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,440
 we have a field again.

303
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,519
 However, the important part

304
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:07,320
 we have now by construction

305
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:09,010
 is the completeness axiom.

306
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:10,959
 Every Cauchy sequence is now

307
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,429
 actually convergent

308
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,489
 with this, we can close this

309
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,929
 video and I hope that you

310
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,700
 now know a lot about real

311
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:18,359
 numbers.

312
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:20,359
 And in the next videos we

313
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:21,859
 will talk about the complex

314
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:22,519
 numbers.

315
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,230
 Therefore, I hope I see you

316
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,720
 there and have a nice day.

317
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:26,489
 Bye.
