Hello and welcome to Riemann integral vs. Lebesgue integral.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,842
Often students ask me why we have two integral notions at all. 

3
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:15,482
Or why we need the Lebesgue integral when we already have the Riemann integral.

4
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:22,500
In this video, I explain why we go from the classical integral definition, which is the Riemann integral,

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,100
to the more modern one, which is the Lebesgue integral.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,700
However, let us first start with the Riemann integral.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:36,300
Here, we want to integrate a function f that starts from R and goes into R.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:43,900
So a normal function defined on the real line and with values in the real line.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,500
And as you should know, this integral is related to the calculation of an area below a graph.

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,100
So let me do a rough drawing of the graph of the function f here.

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:03,700
And consider an interval on the real line. So maybe start with a and go to b.

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:14,500
Then we are talking about this area below the graph. So exactly this one.

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:25,100
In short, this means the Riemann integral of the function f, from the interval [a,b], is related to this area here.

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:33,700
Therefore, we have the well-known idea to choose a partition of the x-axis and to approximate this area by choosing rectangles.

15
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:39,300
And this approximation is known as the lower sum or the upper sum.

16
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,900
So what I draw here is the well-known lower sum.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,500
And if we now choose finer and finer partitions, 

18
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,800
we call this limit of the lower or upper sums the Riemann integral if the limit is well-defined.

19
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,400
Well, this was a short summary of the Riemann integral.

20
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,000
And now we immediately find some problems here. 

21
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,600
These problems give us a reason to define another integral notion.

22
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:15,200
Firstly, it is difficult to expand the Riemann integral to higher dimensions.

23
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:23,400
Yes, you can expand to higher dimensions. So it is possible but very laborious.

24
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,600
For example, if we would have a 2 here.

25
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:34,200
This means that the x-axis here is now a two-dimensional space.
So we can't use rectangles for the partition.

26
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,100
Of course, we now could use cuboids.

27
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:56,200
So this is the two-dimensional space in the domain of definition R^2;
then our partition is now just rectangles in the plane.
And our integral approximation now is given by cuboids. So maybe in this way.

28
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:07,200
As you can see, it gets very technical and it will be much more
work with additional dimension. Just one more dimension but you have to much more work.

29
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,500
For example, to build the limit process in the end.

30
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,400
This is directly clear if we consider the domain of definition here.

31
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:25,400
In the one-dimensional case, we only had an interval, which is an easy thing
since it starts with a and ends with b. Just an interval.

32
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:33,700
But even if we add even one dimension more.
So here is the picture, x1, x2, f(x1,x2).

33
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,300
So even if we even add just one dimension, there are a lot of more possibilities.

34
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,000
For example, the domain of definition for the function could be a circle in this plane.

35
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,600
So let us focus on the domain of definition now.

36
00:03:47,700 --> 00:04:00,200
So I draw another picture, just the x1, x2 axis;
and then we find the circle just there. 
Now, what we now want to do is to choose a partition of the circle and put the cuboids above.

37
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:17,400
However, fo course, this is not exactly possible. So we can put rectangles inside the circle here.
But as you can see: we even need a limit process to approximate the circle in the domain.

38
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:23,000
Again I say it: it is feasible but it's a lot more technical work.

39
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,600
In summary, this is one problem of the Riemann integral, 
we directly understand. 

40
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,200
It is much more work to do this in higher dimensions. 

41
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,700
The second problem of the Riemann integral, and what you should know
from this one dimensional case,

42
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,350
It is that we need some continuity property for the functions
we want to integrate 

43
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,950
in other words:

44
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,050
we have some dependence on continuity.

45
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:57,650
Recall that in the best case, the function we want to integrate
should be continuous. Then we don't have any problems.

46
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:05,350
However, if have discontinuity points, then there should be only finitely many of them.

47
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:10,050
But if we have infinitely many, it can destroy the integrability of the function.

48
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,650
I hope you know the typical example.

49
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,250
So an easy function that you can't integrate using the Riemann integral.

50
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,450
Hence, the dependence here is, indeed, a disadvantage of the Riemann integral.

51
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:31,250
Now the most important disadvantage of the Riemann integral is the relationship to limit processes.

52
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:44,850
The question here is in which situations is it allowed to interchange
some limit processes? Or in other words, can I pull in the limit sign inside the integral sign.

53
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,050
So let me show this in an example.

54
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,150
So we have the limit n to infinity

55
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,750
and we integrate a function from a to b (so this is sequence of functions f_n)

56
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,050
and we integrate them with respect to x.

57
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:08,850
The question is then: when is allowed to pull or push the limit inside the integral.

58
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,850
When does this equality hold?

59
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,450
For the Riemann integral, we don't have many possibilities here.

60
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,050
We also need the uniform convergence of this sequence of functions.

61
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,650
only then we know that is allowed to pull the limit inside the integral.

62
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:35,250
However, this uniform convergence is a very strong notion, 

63
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,850
and in some sense, it's related to the continuity, again. 

64
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,450
And therefore, we want to weaken this notion.

65
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:47,050
Indeed, we have a lot of examples where there is no
uniform convergence of the sequences of functions at all,

66
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,250
and we still have the same result on both sides. 

67
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:56,550
Hence we know it should be possible to generalise this convergence theorem.

68
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,150
However, not by using the Riemann integral.

69
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:06,750
The Riemann integral is just not flexible enough to prove such a convergence theorem.

70
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:14,350
Well these are three important points that show the difficulties
we may have when we use the Riemann integral. 

71
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:26,950
Most importantly, we have a wish to the generalisation to higher dimensions.
So we want an integral notion that is not restricted to one dimension. 

72
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:34,550
So we don't want to do all the work again if we just change the space of the domain of definition here.

73
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,150
We want an integral that works in every dimension the same.

74
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,750
In order to understand this generalisation,

75
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,350
we need more technical details.

76
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,950
Hence, I would suggest, we start with the Riemann integral.

77
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:58,550
Again, we do some sketch (so we have the x- and the y-axis). We also have a function, where I draw the graph in green.

78
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:05,050
So we have a function with values in the real numbers.

79
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:14,550
For the Riemann integral we now choose a partition of the x-axis as before;
and now we can calculate the upper and lower sum. 

80
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,150
Here I have drawn the lower sum.

81
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:23,450
This means that we take the infimum in each subinterval for the height of the rectangles.

82
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:29,050
And for the upper sum, we will take the supremum.

83
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,650
So here, for example, this rectangle. Hence we get the upper sum.

84
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:42,050
If the difference between the upper and lower sum can be made
arbitrarily small, for a finer partition, 

85
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,650
then we can define the Riemann integral.

86
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:51,250
Then you can define it as the supremum of the lower sums or the infimum of the upper sums.

87
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:58,550
This is then the same value
and this value is then called the Riemann integral for the function f in the interval [a,b].

88
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:07,150
In order to this, it was necessary that we have a function that goes from the real numbers into the real numbers. 

89
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,050
Otherwise, we can't do the partition of the x-axis, and we don't have a height.

90
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:16,650
The idea of the Lebesgue integral is now different.

91
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,250

92
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,850
As you have seen before, it was very restrictive to find a partition of the domain of definition.

93
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,050
(if it is not R itself)

94
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,650
If, for example, we have a three-dimensional space, 

95
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,450
then we can't find a partition easily.

96
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,050
But we map still in the real numbers.

97
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:41,150
So the right-hand side is still the same since we consider functions,

98
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,750
so functions with values in the real numbers.

99
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,850
So this is the same, but the left-hand side not the same.

100
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,450
This means that the domain of definition, the left-hand side here, 

101
00:09:51,550 --> 00:10:00,050
can be very high-, or even very abstract,
and therefore, we don't know what a meaningful partition of the left-hand side should be.

102
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:06,650
Just because we don't have these simple intervals in a higher dimensional or abstract space.

103
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:13,250
However, on the right-hand side, we still find the real numbers, the one-dimensional space of the real numbers. 

104
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:21,350
So instead of finding for a partition of the x-axis;
it would be easier to just find a partition of the y-axis.

105
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,550
And indeed, this is what the Lebesgue integral does.

106
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:36,880
Although, this is not the way, the Lebesgue measure is normally introduced.
However it is still a very good idea to visualise the Lebesgue integral.

107
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,450
So let us draw the graph again.

108
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:52,050
And keep in mind, the x-axis may be high-dimensional or even abstract, but the y-axis is still the real line.

109
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:59,650
And that is what we decompose now.
Since this is only the real line, we can find the same interval partition as before.

110
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,250
So we choose some values and define some intervals here.

111
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:09,550
So this is a partition of the real line as we did before on the Riemann integral on the x-axis.

112
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:19,250
So maybe we call these partition elements C_i,
while in the Riemann integral we usually call them x_i.

113
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:27,350
Maybe as a reminder: In the Riemann integral we defined an upper sum
of some partition of the x-axis.

114
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:35,950
So you would write U(P)
and this is the sum of the rectangles,

115
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:50,050
which means we have the sum and then choose the supremum 
inside the interval times the length Delta x_i.

116
00:11:50,150 --> 00:12:02,450
And you can do the same for the lower sum L(P),
given by infimum in the given interval

117
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:15,050
times the length of the rectangles/intervals
Delta x_i.

118
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,650
In this way, we defined the Riemann integral. 

119
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:23,250
However, now we want to decompose the y-axis,
for getting the Lebesgue integral.

120
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:29,850
We have the following picture.
For example, this line here ...

121
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:44,450
... this value gives you this line from here
and we have this line here.

122
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:50,550
Now, we want to find all the parts of the function
that lie between these two lines.

123
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:55,150
So meaning: inside this interval in the real line.

124
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:04,750
This means that we don't draw rectangles like before, but we look at which parts of the function
fall between these two lines.

125
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:17,350
So we find here that we have a part on the left-hand side,
so we find all the arguments in x, that lie in this set,

126
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:23,950
are sent to values inside this interval by the function f.

127
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,550
And we also have here a part of the function.

128
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:34,150
And we find all the arguments of x that are sent 

129
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,750
to the interval.

130
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:44,350
Now these two parts are associated to the decomposition/partition of the y-axis, c_i, we chose.

131
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:50,950
This is similar to the idea of the Riemann integral,

132
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,150
but we immediately see

133
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:59,550
that the decomposition of the x-axis below here is not connected.

134
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,150
Then we have different sets that are not connected like the intervals
that we saw before.

135
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:08,750
And this is the whole idea. Instead of choosing a fixed partition of the x-axis,

136
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:13,650
we now choose a partition of the y-axis, of the values of the function.

137
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,050
And then we get a useful partition of the x-axis

138
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,650
that we can work with.

139
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:26,250
Now the next question could be how to measure these lengths
on the x-axis below.

140
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:36,850
Therefore on the domain of definition which is here
R^3, (or it could be some space)

141
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:42,450
We need a so-called measure.
We want to measure volumes in the space.

142
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:47,750
This means that we want to measure the size of sets
inside this space.

143
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:58,350
For example, if this space is R, we measure lengths.
In R^2, we measure areas.
In R^3, we measure volumes of sets.

144
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,950
But, in an abstract sense, we will always speak of VOLUMES.

145
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:13,550
Hence, on the x-axis here we could choose a general measure space. We just have to know how to measure
the size of sets,

146
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,150
the volumes of sets!

147
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,750
Such a measure space is usually denoted by Ω.

148
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,350

149
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:27,950
This means that in the end we will have an integral that
works on all functions that are defined on some measure space Ω.

150
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,350
Indeed, this is all we need to define the integral.

151
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:36,950
Now you see how we could define
an "upper sum" in some sense.

152
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,550
So we take these c_i here,

153
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:56,150
and now I want the c_i to be this one. So the c_i is this stripe here.
So this would be an upper sum of the integral if we know the measure of these sets together.

154
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:04,750
Of course, these blue sets are the preimage of this interval under the function f.

155
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,900
Maybe we just call it A.

156
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Now if I call the measure we have here in our measure space just by
μ,

157
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,600
then we calculate this generalised rectangle.

158
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:35,200
It is c_i (the height) times the length on the bottom. This is the measure of our set A, μ(A).
Now we have one part of the whole integral and now we can do it for the whole partition.

159
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:45,300
So we have a finite sum over i.
c_i times μ(Ai)
Of course, I should also put an index i on the preimage. Then we have a sum.

160
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,900
Since we chose a finite partition on the y-axis, we have finite sum here.

161
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:56,000
and it will be the upper or lower sum depending which

162
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,000
c_i we chose here.

163
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,200
Then again, with some limit process with finer partitions

164
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,800
we will get the Lebesgue integral.

165
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,400
Usually denoted by integral f dμ.

166
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,000
Since it is now depending on the measure we chose on the x-axis.

167
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:21,600
This construction now works with arbitrary measure spaces,
since the x-axis does not need a partition any more.

168
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:31,200
We just need a partition of the axis that is R anyway.
However, in this case, we really need the notion of a measure,

169
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,800
even in one dimension.

170
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,400
So here, in R, we know what the length of a subinterval is,

171
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,000
it is simply the difference between the right side
and the left side.

172
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,200
But here we need more.

173
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:51,800
Or in other words:
In the Riemann integral we only measured the lengths of intervals
but in the Lebesgue integral we can have any fragmentation

174
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,900
and we have to know the measure of this fragmentation.

175
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,500
But if we know how to measure any set in the real line,

176
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,100
then we have a very robust integral definition.

177
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,700
Well this generalizes the Riemann integral and eliminates

178
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,000
all problems we had in higher dimensions.

179
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:19,600
Since this measure theory works for any dimension you want. We just have to know how to measure volumes.

180
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:30,200
We have also eliminated the problem of dependency on continuity
since we can now measure the size of the set of points where
there is discontinuity.

181
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:40,800
For example, if we had a set with infinite points of discontinuity,
but the measure of this whole set was 0,

182
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,000
we don't have a problem in the definition of the integral at all.

183
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,100
And also for the last point, so these limit processes,

184
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,100
we have good answers for.

185
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:58,700
We will see that we have very good limit theorems
that describe these limit processes
for the Lebesgue integral.

186
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:05,300
Even strong results for the one-dimensional case but also in the general case of measure spaces.

187
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:12,900
Okay, to sum it up, the Riemann integral is the classical notion,
it may be easier to understand at a beginner level,

188
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,500
but in the end, everyone wants to work with the Lebesgue integral.

189
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,100
Thank you very much and see you next time.
