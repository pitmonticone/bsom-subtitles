1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:04,044
The mathematical symbol of today is the Levi-Civita symbol.

2
00:00:04,686 --> 00:00:09,755
Which is written as a lower case epsilon, with 3 indices "i", "j" and "k".

3
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,700
This symbol represents exactly 3 numbers.

4
00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:17,252
It's either 1, -1 or 0.

5
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:25,616
and we distinguish these 3 cases depending in which order the numbers 1, 2 and 3 occur in the indices here.

6
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:28,207
If its in the correct order,

7
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:31,370
which means like you would count. 1, 2, 3.

8
00:00:31,586 --> 00:00:33,554
Then we get out 1.

9
00:00:34,486 --> 00:00:36,649
On the other hand, if its backwards.

10
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:41,003
So like you would count for a countdown. 3, 2, 1.

11
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:43,201
Then we get out -1.

12
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:50,042
In fact in this counting order i described, also cyclic permutations are allowed.

13
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:58,445
For example in the first case the last position could be the 1, if then the first position is 2 and then comes 3.

14
00:00:59,057 --> 00:01:02,457
So this counting here goes in a cyclic way.

15
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:07,117
Hence the third possibility here, would be 3, 1, 2.

16
00:01:07,857 --> 00:01:10,171
This is also counting forwards.

17
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:16,678
On the other hand another possibility for counting backwards would be 2, 1, 3.

18
00:01:17,257 --> 00:01:20,124
Also here you should think in a cyclic way.

19
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:25,320
and finally then the last possibility would be 1, 3, 2.

20
00:01:26,143 --> 00:01:31,369
So what you can remember is, the cyclic order here gives us a sign for the symbol.

21
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:38,788
and then in all other cases, maybe all the indices here are equal to 1. We get out 0.

22
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:43,995
Ok, that's the whole definition of the Levi-Civita symbol, with 3 indices.

23
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:48,143
There are also generalisations with more indices,

24
00:01:48,144 --> 00:01:53,114
but this one is the most important one, because we can use it in 3 dimensions.

25
00:01:53,743 --> 00:02:01,247
For example it's helpful when we deal with the cross product of two 3-dimensional vectors, "a" and "b".

26
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,226
So the result of this crossproduct is again a vector with 3 components.

27
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,929
So we can ask, what is the i-th component of it.

28
00:02:11,643 --> 00:02:16,407
and it turns out, this can be calculated using the Levi-Civita symbol.

29
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:21,698
It's the double sum over all possibilities for "j" and "k"

30
00:02:21,914 --> 00:02:25,870
and then we take the Levi-Civita symbol, epsilon_i_j_k.

31
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:32,788
times the j-th component of "a" times the k-th component of "b".

32
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:40,278
In fact this is a formula some people use to define the cross product of two 3-dimensional vectors.

33
00:02:41,443 --> 00:02:44,372
Ok, so this is the Levi-Civita symbol.

34
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:46,178
Thanks for listening!
