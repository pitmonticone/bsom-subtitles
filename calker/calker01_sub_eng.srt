00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,740
Today I show you how to calculate the kernel of a given matrix.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:13,447
And this will be an easy example of a 3x4 matrix.

4
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, this is the matrix, we will consider here.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,708
And we will consider it over the real numbers,
and as you can see, it has 3 rows.

6
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:32,102
So 3x4 and 4 is the number of the columns here.

7
00:00:32,102 --> 00:00:36,248
However, first of all, you have to know what the kernel is.

8
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:45,467
So the kernel of a matrix A is, by definition, the set of all vectors that are sent to 0 by this matrix.

9
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:55,815
So this means that we have here all vectors x and they come from R^4, since we have 4 columns here.

10
00:00:55,815 --> 00:01:04,131
So we need a vector with 4 rows and then we can give Ax a meaning. So Ax.

11
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:11,548
So this will be a vector in R^3 and this goes to the zero vector in R^3.

12
00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:22,149
So Ax = 0.
Well, this subspace of R^4 is exactly the kernel of A.

13
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:28,289
And as you can see, this is just a system of linear equations.

14
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:36,934
So we calculate the kernel by solving the system of linear equations given by the matrix and the right-hand side: 0.

15
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:44,867
Therefore, this means that we can row operations  on this system of linear equations, here.

16
00:01:44,867 --> 00:01:48,867
And they don't change the system, so the solution set!

17
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:58,867
We want the solution set here for the kernel. So we can just do row operations on this matrix inside the kernel here.

18
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:02,867
And we don't change the kernel! So this is what we do now.

19
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:08,867
We want to change the second and the third row.

20
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:14,104
In such a way that we can create zeros here in the first column.

21
00:02:14,104 --> 00:02:25,067
So, meaning, we have to add, on the second row, a multiple of the first row. And this is just 3.

22
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:32,067
So, -3 times the first row gives us what we want here.

23
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:41,934
So 0 here; there we have -2; and -2; and 1.

24
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:51,400
Then, we do the same for the third row. So third row minus 4 times the first row.

25
00:02:51,400 --> 00:03:06,000
And then we have the zero as wanted, and -8 (so -4 -4); and -8 as well; and +4 here.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay, now we have the zeros in the first column and we want to do the same in the second column as well.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,134
So we want to create a zero here.

28
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:29,267
As you can see, this is very easy now. So the new third row here gets just 4 times the new second row here.

29
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:34,334
And just with minus again.

30
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:41,808
And then we get: 0, 0, 0, 0.
So very boring here.

31
00:03:41,808 --> 00:03:50,067
But, of course, this was obvious since just the third row here is just a multiple of the second row.

32
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:57,734
And now we are finished since we arrived at the so-called row echelon form here.

33
00:03:57,734 --> 00:04:07,467
Or in other words, just a triangle form here since all elements below this diagonal here are zero.

34
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:11,467
This is what we want. Then the system is solved.

35
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:23,067
Now, we call these variables here, given by these non-zero elements in each column, the bound variables (= leading variables).

36
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:31,000
And the other ones here, so the 2 here, are the free variables.

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,067
And now we can just write it down.

38
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:45,267
The second row here is an equation. So please keep in mind that we just have the equation with right-hand side zero.

39
00:04:45,267 --> 00:05:00,267
That means that we have, here for the second row, we have -2 times x_2  minus 2 x_3 plus x_4 is equal to zero.

40
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:05,000
So, now we already set here the free variables.

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,534
So, we can just choose here another letter, maybe an alpha and here a beta.

42
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:20,934
And then, we can just write the bound variable in terms of the free variables.

43
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:28,800
So here x_2 (so this implies) x_2 is equal to minus alpha.

44
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,480
(so we just divide by 2)

45
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,800
Plus one half beta.

46
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:51,734
And the equation in the first row gives us x_1 plus x_2 plus 2 times x_3 plus x_4  equals to zero.

47
00:05:51,734 --> 00:06:02,334
But we already know that we can write (maybe I put this here into orange)

48
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:09,000
We can write x_2 as minus alpha plus one half beta.

49
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We know that this here is just 2 times alpha and this is just beta.

50
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:32,134
So we can write x_1 also in terms of alpha and beta. And this is just minus alpha (so 2 alpha minus one)

51
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:39,267
And minus three half beta.

52
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:50,467
Of course, this is the solution set of our system of linear equations given by Ax = 0.

53
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:55,267
So now we can just write the solution set, that is the kernel.

54
00:06:55,267 --> 00:07:06,000
So, set brackets here and then we have the vector. So it's minus alpha minus three half beta.

55
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,200
This comes from the x_1 component. And then we have the x_2 component.

56
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:24,667
Minus alpha plus one half beta. And x_3 and x_4 were the free variables, so just alpha and beta here.

57
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:33,067
And most importantly, don't forget to write "alpha, beta are coming from R". So they are elements in R.

58
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:35,667
And this is the whole solution set.

59
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:41,667
So an arbitrary vector given in this form where alpha and beta are coming from R.

60
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:50,734
So, of course, we can split this up into two vectors. So we use the alpha coefficient.

61
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:57,467
Then we have the vector: -1, -1, 1, and zero.

62
00:07:57,467 --> 00:08:09,067
Plus beta and the vector with coefficients in front of beta, so: minus three half, plus one half, 0 and 1.

63
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:17,000
And the same again: we have to mention that alpha and beta are coming from the real numbers.

64
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,934
So obviously, this is the same set. So we just wrote the vector in another way.

65
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:29,534
And this is the whole kernel. And by our calculation, we know

66
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:39,134
that these two vectors here are linearly independent and therefore form a basis of the kernel.

67
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:44,867
Of this kernel of A.

68
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:54,800
That means: for this example, the kernel is a two-dimensional subset of R^4.

69
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:02,198
And this is all for today. Thank you for watching!
