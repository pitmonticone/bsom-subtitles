00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,049
 Hello and welcome to

2
00:00:02,059 --> 00:00:03,779
 start learning numbers, a

3
00:00:03,789 --> 00:00:05,039
 video course where we will

4
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,320
 discuss all the different

5
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:08,130
 sets of numbers starting

6
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,220
 with the natural numbers

7
00:00:09,229 --> 00:00:10,899
 and going all the way until

8
00:00:10,909 --> 00:00:12,579
 we reach the complex numbers.

9
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,420
 But first, I want to thank

10
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,659
 all the nice people that

11
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,180
 made this course possible

12
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,649
 by supporting me on Steady

13
00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:19,459
 and paypal.

14
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,870
 When you first see mathematics,

15
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,819
 you often see that mathematics

16
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:25,159
 starts with calculations,

17
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,959
 calculations with numbers.

18
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,329
 And the numbers start with

19
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,370
 the natural numbers,

20
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:33,069
 they are called natural numbers

21
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,229
 because they are an

22
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,110
 abstraction we can immediately

23
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,639
 see in our natural world.

24
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,090
 In fact, even as Children,

25
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:41,810
 we already get the conception

26
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:43,159
 for counting things

27
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:45,250
 and the abstraction or

28
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:46,930
 generalization that comes

29
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:48,740
 from counting different objects

30
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,599
 is what leads us to the natural

31
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,220
 numbers.

32
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,720
 So they just represent different

33
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:55,700
 sizes we can have for collections

34
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:56,659
 of some objects.

35
00:00:57,419 --> 00:00:58,810
 Therefore, it makes sense

36
00:00:58,819 --> 00:01:00,419
 to introduce new symbols

37
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,069
 for these representations.

38
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:04,029
 Now please keep in mind for

39
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,680
 the mathematics we will explore,

40
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,860
 it does not matter which

41
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,580
 name we give these numbers.

42
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:09,940
 But the actual concept of

43
00:01:09,949 --> 00:01:11,910
 numbers is important with

44
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:13,489
 this, you could say the natural

45
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,989
 numbers we want to consider

46
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,949
 is the set N that consists

47
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,750
 of all of these new symbols.

48
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,709
 However, if you watch my

49
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,919
 explanations for the set

50
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,430
 theory, you already know

51
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:25,139
 that this here is not a

52
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,400
 complete definition for a

53
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:26,870
 set.

54
00:01:27,389 --> 00:01:28,430
 Therefore, the question would

55
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,139
 be how do we define the

56
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,779
 natural numbers just with

57
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,279
 sets?

58
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:34,089
 This is what we'll answer

59
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,029
 in this video.

60
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,629
 More precisely, we will

61
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,360
 construct the natural numbers

62
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,010
 that also include zero as

63
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:40,589
 a number.

64
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,940
 I will use the symbol N zero

65
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:44,930
 for this set but be careful

66
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,519
 often.

67
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:47,410
 Also N is used for this

68
00:01:47,419 --> 00:01:47,889
 set here.

69
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,089
 OK.

70
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:50,489
 With this, let's start

71
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,910
 constructing the natural

72
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:52,599
 numbers.

73
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:55,000
 As we have seen in our examples

74
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,599
 with apples and oranges.

75
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,449
 The size of a set can be

76
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:00,019
 used to define a number

77
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,489
 and we already know one particular

78
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,199
 set, namely the empty

79
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:06,150
 set by definition,

80
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,669
 the empty set does not have

81
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,750
 any elements.

82
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,169
 So it represents the number

83
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:10,669
 zero.

84
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,830
 And now it makes sense to

85
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:14,729
 use this as a definition

86
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,490
 for our new symbol zero.

87
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,029
 Maybe it looks a little bit

88
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,759
 strange here.

89
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,369
 But keep in mind we already

90
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,809
 have the set theory.

91
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,449
 So it makes sense that every

92
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,449
 new object we introduce should

93
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,490
 also be a set.

94
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,449
 We did the same thing when

95
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,339
 we introduced ordered pairs

96
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,220
 and maps.

97
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:33,179
 Now for the next step for

98
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,789
 defining the number one as

99
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,419
 a set, we need a new

100
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:38,229
 set that contains only one

101
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,210
 element we could take

102
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,830
 any element we want.

103
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,009
 But the only thing that is

104
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,729
 defined yet is the empty set.

105
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,619
 So we put zero inside the

106
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,550
 set brackets and we get out

107
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:50,229
 a new set.

108
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:52,229
 What you should see is that

109
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,190
 what we do here is exactly

110
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,479
 the same thing we had in

111
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,789
 mind when we dealt with the

112
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,550
 oranges.

113
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,270
 However, here we don't need

114
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,949
 any real world objects.

115
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,589
 We just need the abstract

116
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,300
 concepts in set theory.

117
00:03:04,899 --> 00:03:05,240
 OK.

118
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,470
 Now, for the number two,

119
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,949
 we need two elements.

120
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,050
 So what do we do?

121
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,990
 We take the only two elements

122
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,669
 we know.

123
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,009
 So zero and one,

124
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,360
 because we know they are

125
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:17,350
 different at this point,

126
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,589
 you should see how this game

127
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,479
 works and we can just continue

128
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:20,639
 it.

129
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,059
 Therefore, this is our number

130
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,059
 three as a set in the same

131
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,220
 way, we can write down the

132
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:27,139
 number four.

133
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:29,380
 However, here you might already

134
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:30,880
 wish for a shorter way to

135
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:31,679
 write it down.

136
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,860
 And of course, if you compare

137
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:35,690
 to the set before three,

138
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:37,619
 we just add one element.

139
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:39,820
 For this reason, we can just

140
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,179
 write it as a union.

141
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,690
 So this is what it is and

142
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:45,229
 maybe it looks again a little

143
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,500
 bit strange, but keep in

144
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:48,009
 mind three is a set

145
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,529
 here.

146
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:49,889
 And here we have the set

147
00:03:49,899 --> 00:03:51,410
 that contains three as an

148
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:52,050
 element.

149
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:52,949
 OK?

150
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,410
 But with this formula, you

151
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,130
 now know how to construct

152
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:57,800
 the next number in order.

153
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,070
 And then we get all the

154
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,770
 numbers we want to have.

155
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,529
 And after that, we want to

156
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,309
 put them into one set

157
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,240
 and call it the natural numbers

158
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:07,979
 and zero.

159
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,970
 However, there you might

160
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:11,630
 see a problem because this

161
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,479
 whole construction here never

162
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,089
 stops.

163
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,360
 Or to put it.

164
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:16,670
 In other words, the natural

165
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:18,608
 numbers, the set and zero

166
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:20,420
 should have infinitely many

167
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,170
 elements.

168
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,010
 And that is something we

169
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:24,660
 have to put into our set

170
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,209
 theory.

171
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,040
 So we call it an axiom.

172
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,920
 It's simply something we

173
00:04:28,929 --> 00:04:30,799
 put as a true statement

174
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:32,059
 into our theory.

175
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,160
 For example, the existence

176
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,880
 of the empty set was also

177
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,619
 an axiom.

178
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,459
 We put into the set theory.

179
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,429
 And now we want to put in

180
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,899
 the existence of the natural

181
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:42,459
 numbers.

182
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,850
 So we say there's a set N

183
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:46,570
 zero with the following two

184
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:47,380
 properties.

185
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,160
 The first one is that we

186
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,239
 have a starting point at

187
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:50,799
 zero.

188
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:52,119
 So the set zero

189
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,859
 lies in N zero.

190
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:55,700
 And the second one tells

191
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:57,470
 us that for all numbers in

192
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,410
 N zero, also the

193
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,290
 successor lies in N zero.

194
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:03,140
 And now we know we can write

195
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:04,559
 it as this set here

196
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:06,579
 as a reminder here, we have

197
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:08,250
 the conditional form logic.

198
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:10,230
 And I already told you sometimes

199
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:11,290
 it's written with a double

200
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:13,059
 arrow later, we will

201
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,769
 also do this just to avoid

202
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:16,140
 confusion with the arrow

203
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:16,970
 for maps.

204
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,140
 However, to finish our axiom

205
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:20,660
 here, we also have to say

206
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,029
 that N zero is the

207
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,730
 smallest set that has

208
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:24,779
 these properties.

209
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:26,769
 This simply means that any

210
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:28,019
 other set with these two

211
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:29,880
 properties is a superset

212
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,899
 of N zero.

213
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:31,890
 OK.

214
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,500
 And with this, we finally

215
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,769
 have the natural numbers.

216
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:35,989
 In our set theory,

217
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,279
 it's constructed with sets,

218
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,880
 it has sets as elements

219
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,279
 such that we can work with

220
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:41,440
 it.

221
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,040
 That's how you should see

222
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:43,279
 it.

223
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,559
 It's not the explanation

224
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,480
 of numbers.

225
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,079
 It's a working tool for us.

226
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,570
 Therefore, it's often called

227
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,450
 a model for the natural numbers.

228
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:53,290
 Now, with the natural numbers,

229
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:54,609
 we immediately get a map,

230
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:56,209
 we call the successor map,

231
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:58,790
 we denote it with S and it

232
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:00,649
 goes from N zero into

233
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,390
 N zero.

234
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,149
 And the definition, we already

235
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,869
 know we send the number X

236
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:05,869
 to the union

237
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,640
 because we learned this gives

238
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:09,760
 us the successor.

239
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,899
 For example, if we put the

240
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,540
 number six into the map,

241
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:15,260
 we get out the number seven.

242
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:16,529
 OK?

243
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,670
 I think that's good enough

244
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:18,470
 for an introduction.

245
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:20,100
 In the next video, we will

246
00:06:20,109 --> 00:06:21,510
 talk about all the properties

247
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,989
 of the natural numbers and

248
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,850
 also how we can define the

249
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:25,470
 addition.

250
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,089
 So I hope I see you there

251
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,190
 and have a nice day.

252
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:28,980
 Bye.
